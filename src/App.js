Revenue of $30 billion was up 15% sequentially and up 122% year-on-year and well above our outlook of $28 billion. Starting with data center, data center revenue of $26.3 billion was a record, up 16% sequentially and up 154% year-on-year, driven by strong demand for NVIDIA Hopper, GPU computing, and our networking platforms. Compute revenue grew more than 2.5 times, networking revenue grew more than 2 times from the last year. Cloud service providers represented roughly 45% for our data center revenue and more than 50% stemmed from the consumer, Internet, and enterprise companies. Customers continue to accelerate their Hopper architecture purchases, while gearing up to adopt Blackwell. Key workloads driving our data center growth include generative AI, model training, and inferencing. Video, image, and text data pre and post-processing with CUDA and AI workloads, synthetic data generation, AI-powered recommender systems, SQL, and vector database processing as well. Next-generation models will require 10 to 20 times more compute to train with significantly more data. The trend is expected to continue. Over the trailing four quarters, we estimate that inference drove more than 40% of our data center revenue. CSPs, consumer Internet companies, and enterprises benefit from the incredible throughput and efficiency of NVIDIA's inference platform. Demand for NVIDIA is coming from frontier model makers, consumer Internet services, and tens of thousands of companies and startups building generative AI applications for consumers, advertising, education, enterprise and healthcare, and robotics. Developers desire NVIDIA's rich ecosystem and availability in every cloud. CSPs appreciate the broad adoption of NVIDIA and are growing their NVIDIA capacity given the high demand. NVIDIA H200 platform began ramping in Q2, shipping to large CSPs, consumer Internet, and enterprise company. The NVIDIA H200 builds upon the strength of our Hopper architecture and offering, over 40% more memory bandwidth compared to the H100. Our data center revenue in China grew sequentially in Q2 and is a significant contributor to our data center revenue. As a percentage of total data center revenue, it remains below levels seen prior to the imposition of export controls. We continue to expect the China market to be very competitive going-forward. The latest round of MLPerf inference benchmarks highlighted NVIDIA's inference leadership with both NVIDIA, Hopper, and Blackwell platforms combining to win gold medals on all tasks. At Computex, NVIDIA with the top computer manufacturers unveiled an array of Blackwell architecture-powered systems and NVIDIA networking for building AI factories and data centers. With the NVIDIA MGX modular reference architecture, our OEMs and ODM partners are building more than 100 Blackwell-based systems designed quickly and cost-effectively. The NVIDIA Blackwell platform brings together multiple GPU, CPU, DPU, NVLink, NVLink switch, and the networking chips systems, and NVIDIA CUDA software to power the next-generation of AI across the cases, industries, and countries. The NVIDIA GB 200 NVL72 system with the fifth-generation NVLink enables all 72 GPUs to act as a single GPU and deliver up to 30 times faster inference for LLMs, workloads, and unlocking the ability to run trillion parameter models in real-time. Hopper demand is strong and Blackwell is widely sampling. We executed a change to the Blackwell GPU mass to improve production yields. Blackwell production ramp is scheduled to begin in the fourth quarter and continue into fiscal year '26. In Q4, we expect to ship several billion dollars in Blackwell revenue. Hopper shipments are expected to increase in the second half of fiscal 2025. Hopper supply and availability have improved. Demand for Blackwell platforms is well above supply, and we expect this to continue into next year. Networking revenue increased 16% sequentially. Our Ethernet for AI revenue, which includes our Spectrum-X end-to-end Ethernet platform, doubled sequentially with hundreds of customers adopting our Ethernet offerings. Spectrum-X has broad market support from OEM and ODM partners and is being adopted by CSPs, GPU cloud providers, and enterprise, including X-AI to connect the largest GPU compute cluster in the world. Spectrum-X supercharges Ethernet for AI processing and delivers 1.6 times the performance of traditional Ethernet. We plan to launch new Spectrum-X products every year to support demand for scaling compute clusters from tens of thousands of DPUs today to millions of GPUs in the near future. Spectrum-X is well on-track to begin a multi-billion dollar product line within a year. Our sovereign AI opportunities continue to expand as countries recognize AI expertise and infrastructure at national imperatives for their society and industries. Japan's National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology is building its AI bridging cloud infrastructure 3.0 supercomputer with NVIDIA. We believe sovereign AI revenue will reach low-double-digit billions this year. The enterprise AI wave has started. Enterprises also drove sequential revenue growth in the quarter. We are working with most of the Fortune 100 companies on AI initiatives across industries and geographies. A range of applications are fueling our growth, including AI-powered chatbots, generative AI copilots, and agents to build new monetizable business applications and enhance employee productivity. Amdocs is using NVIDIA generative AI for their smart agent, transforming the customer experience and reducing customer service costs by 30%. ServiceNow is using NVIDIA for its Now Assist offering, the fastest-growing new product in the company's history. SAP is using NVIDIA to build dual Co-pilots. Cohesity is using NVIDIA to build their generative AI agent and lower generative AI development costs. Snowflake serves over 3 billion queries a day for over 10,000 enterprise customers is working with NVIDIA to build Copilots. And lastly, Wistron is using NVIDIA AI Omniverse to reduce end-to-end cycle times for their factories by 50%. Automotive was a key growth driver for the quarter as every automaker developing autonomous vehicle technology is using NVIDIA in their data centers. Automotive will drive multi-billion dollars in revenue across on-prem and cloud consumption and will grow as next-generation AV models require significantly more compute. Healthcare is also on its way to being a multi-billion dollar business as AI revolutionizes medical imaging, surgical robots, patient care, electronic health record processing, and drug discovery. During the quarter, we announced a new NVIDIA AI foundry service to supercharge generative AI for the world's enterprises with Meta's Llama 3.1, collection of models. This marks a watershed moment for enterprise AI. Companies for the first time can leverage the capabilities of an open-source frontier-level model to develop customized AI applications to encode their institutional knowledge into an AI flywheel to automate and accelerate their business. Accenture is the first to adopt the new service to build custom Llama 3.1 models for both its own use and to assist clients seeking to deploy generative AI applications. Nvidia NIM accelerate and simplify model deployment. Companies across healthcare, energy, financial services, retail, transportation, and telecommunications are adopting NIMs, including Aramco, Lowe's, and Uber. AT&T realized 70% cost savings and 8 times latency reduction after moving into NIMs for generative AI, call transcription, and classification. Over 150 partners are embedding NIMs across every layer of the AI ecosystem. We announced NIM agent Blueprints, a catalog of customizable reference applications that include a full suite of software for building and deploying enterprise generative AI applications. With NIM agent blueprints, enterprises can refine their AI applications overtime, creating a data-driven AI flywheel. The first NIM agent blueprints include workloads for customer service, computer-aided drug discovery, and enterprise retrieval augmented generation. Our system integrators, technology solution providers, and system builders are bringing NVIDIA NIM agent blueprints to enterprises. NVIDIA NIM and NIM agent blueprints are available through the NVIDIA AI enterprise software platform, which has great momentum. We expect our software, SaaS and support revenue to approach a $2 billion annual run rate exiting this year, with NVIDIA AI Enterprise notably contributing to growth. Moving to gaming and AI PCs. Gaming revenue of $2.88 billion increased 9% sequentially and 16% year-on-year. We saw sequential growth in console, notebook, and desktop revenue and demand is strong and growing and channel inventory remains healthy. Every PC with RTX is an AIPC. RTX PCs can deliver up to 1,300 AI tops and there are now over 200 RTX AI laptops designs from leading PC manufacturers. With 600 AI-powered applications and games and an installed base of 100 million devices, RTX is set to revolutionize consumer experiences with generative AI. NVIDIA ACE, a suite of generative AI technologies is available for RTX, AI PCs. Mecha BREAK is the first game to use NVIDIA ACE, including our small large -- small language model, Minitron-4B optimized on device inference. The NVIDIA gaming ecosystem continues to grow, recently added RTX and DLSS titles including Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Dune Awakening, and Dragon Age: The Veilguard. The GeForce NOW library continues to expand with total catalog size of over 2,000 titles, the most content of any cloud gaming service. Moving to Pro visualization. Revenue of $454 million was up 6% sequentially and 20% year-on-year. Demand is being driven by AI and graphic use cases, including model fine-tuning and Omniverse-related workloads. Automotive and manufacturing were among the key industry verticals driving growth this quarter. Companies are racing to digitalize workflows to drive efficiency across their operations. The world's largest electronics manufacturer, Foxconn is using NVIDIA Omniverse to power digital twins of the physical plants that produce NVIDIA Blackwell systems. And several large global enterprises, including Mercedes-Benz signed multi-year contracts for NVIDIA Omniverse Cloud to build industrial digital twins for factories. We announced new NVIDIA USD NIMs and connectors to open Omniverse to new industries and enable developers to incorporate generative AI Copilots and agents into USD workflows, accelerating their ability to build highly accurate virtual worlds. WPP is implementing USD NIM microservices in its generative AI-enabled content creation pipeline for customers such as the Coca-Cola company. Moving to automotive and robotics, revenue was $346 million, up 5% sequentially and up 37% year-on-year. Year-on-year growth was driven by the new customer ramps in self-driving platforms and increased demand for AI cockpit solutions. At the consumer -- at the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition conference, NVIDIA won the Autonomous Brand Challenge in the end-to-end driving at-scale category, outperforming more than 400 entries worldwide. Austin Dynamics, BYD Electronics, Figure, Intrinsic, Siemens, Skilled ADI, and Teradyne Robotics are using the NVIDIA Isaac Robotics platform for autonomous robot arms, humanoids, and mobile robots. Now moving to the rest of the P&L. GAAP gross margins were 75.1% and non-GAAP gross margins were 75.7%, down sequentially due to a higher mix of new products within data center and inventory provisions for low-yielding Blackwell material. Sequentially, GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses were up 12%, primarily reflecting higher compensation-related costs. Cash flow from operations was $14.5 billion. In Q2, we utilized cash of $7.4 billion towards shareholder returns in the form of share repurchases and cash dividends, reflecting the increase in dividend per share. Our Board of Directors recently approved a $50 billion share repurchase authorization to add to our remaining $7.5 billion of authorization at the end of Q2. Let me turn the outlook for the third quarter. Total revenue is expected to be $32.5 billion, plus or minus 2%. Our third-quarter revenue outlook incorporates continued growth of our Hopper architecture and sampling of our Blackwell products. We expect Blackwell production ramp in Q4. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 74.4% and 75%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. As our data center mix continues to shift to new products, we expect this trend to continue into the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025. For the full-year, we expect gross margins to be in the mid-70% range. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $4.3 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively. Full-year operating expenses are expected to grow in the mid-to-upper 40% range as we work on developing our next generation of products. GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are expected to be about $350 million, including gains and losses from non-affiliated investments and publicly-held equity securities. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 17%, plus or minus 1%, excluding any discrete items. Further financial detail are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website. We are now going to open the call for questions. Operator, would you please help us poll for questions."}],"qanda":[{"speaker":"Operator","text":"Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Your line is open."},{"speaker":"Vivek Arya","text":"Thanks for taking my question. Jensen, you mentioned in the prepared comments that there is a change in the Blackwell GPU mask. I'm curious, are there any other incremental changes in back end packaging or anything else? And I think related, you suggested that you could ship several billion dollars of Blackwell in Q4 despite the change in the design. Is it because all these issues will be solved by then? Just help us size what is the overall impact of any changes in Blackwell timing? What that means to your kind of revenue profile and how are customers reacting to it?"},{"speaker":"Jensen Huang","text":"Yes. Thanks, Vivek. The change to the mask is complete. There were no functional changes necessary. And so we're sampling functional samples of Blackwell -- Grace Blackwell in a variety of system configurations as we speak. There are something like 100 different types of Blackwell-based systems that are built that were shown at Computex. And we're enabling our ecosystem to start sampling those. The functionality of Blackwell is as it is, and we expect to start production in Q4."},{"speaker":"Operator","text":"And your next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open."},{"speaker":"Toshiya Hari","text":"Hi, thank you so much for taking the question. Jensen, I had a relatively longer-term question. As you may know, there's a pretty heated debate in the market on your customers and customer's customers return on investment and what that means for the sustainability of CapEx going forward. Internally at NVIDIA, like what are you guys watching? What's on your dashboard as you try to gauge customer return and how that impacts CapEx? And then a quick follow-up maybe for Colette. I think your sovereign AI number for the full-year went up maybe a couple of billion. What's driving the improved outlook? And how should we think about fiscal '26? Thank you."},{"speaker":"Jensen Huang","text":"Thanks, Toshiya. First of all, when I said ship production in Q4, I mean shipping out. I don't mean starting to ship, but I mean -- I don't mean starting production, but shipping out. On the longer-term question, let's take a step-back and you've heard me say that we're going through two simultaneous platform transitions at the same time. The first one is transitioning from accelerated computing to -- from general-purpose computing to accelerated computing. And the reason for that is because CPU scaling has been known to be slowing for some time. And it is slow to a crawl. And yet the amount of computing demand continues to grow quite significantly. You could maybe even estimate it to be doubling every single year. And so if we don't have a new approach, computing inflation would be driving up the cost for every company, and it would be driving up the energy consumption of data centers around the world. In fact, you're seeing that. And so the answer is accelerated computing. We know that accelerated computing, of course, speeds up applications. It also enables you to do computing at a much larger scale, for example, scientific simulations or database processing. But what that translates directly to is lower cost and lower energy consumed. And in fact, this week, there's a blog that came out that talked about a whole bunch of new libraries that we offer. And that's really the core of the first platform transition going from general purpose computing to accelerated computing. And it's not unusual to see someone save 90% of their computing cost. And the reason for that is, of course, you just sped up an application 50x, you would expect the computing cost to decline quite significantly. The second was enabled by accelerated computing because we drove down the cost of training large language models or training deep learning so incredibly, that it is now possible to have gigantic scale models, multi-trillion parameter models, and train it on -- pre-train it on just about the world's knowledge corpus and let the model go figure out how to understand a human represent -- human language representation and how to codify knowledge into its neural networks and how to learn reasoning, and so -- which caused the generative AI revolution. Now generative AI, taking a step back about why it is that we went so deeply into it is because it's not just a feature, it's not just a capability, it's a fundamental new way of doing software. Instead of human-engineered algorithms, we now have data. We tell the AI, we tell the model, we tell the computer what's the -- what are the expected answers, What are our previous observations. And then for it to figure out what the algorithm is, what's the function. It learns a universal -- AI is a bit of a universal function approximator and it learns the function. And so you could learn the function of almost anything, you know. And anything that you have that's predictable, anything that has structure, anything that you have previous examples of. And so now here we are with generative AI. It's a fundamental new form of computer science. It's affecting how every layer of computing is done from CPU to GPU, from human-engineered algorithms to machine-learned algorithms. And the type of applications you could now develop and produce is fundamentally remarkable. And there are several things that are happening in generative AI. So the first thing that's happening is the frontier models are growing in quite substantial scale. And they're still seeing -- we're still all seeing the benefits of scaling. And whenever you double the size of a model, you also have to more than double the size of the dataset to go train it. And so the amount of flops necessary in order to create that model goes up quadratically. And so it's not unusual -- it's not unexpected to see that the next-generation models could take 20 -- 10, 20, 40 times more compute than last generation. So we have to continue to drive the generational performance up quite significantly, so we can drive down the energy consumed and drive down the cost necessary to do it. So the first one is, there are larger frontier models trained on more modalities and surprisingly, there are more frontier model makers than last year. And so you have more on more on more. That's one of the dynamics going on in generative AI. The second is although it's below the tip of the iceberg. What we see are ChatGPT, image generators, we see coding. We use a generative AI for coding quite extensively here at NVIDIA now. We, of course, have a lot of digital designers and things like that. But those are kind of the tip of the iceberg. What's below the iceberg are the largest systems -- largest computing systems in the world today, which are -- and you've heard me talk about this in the past, which are recommender systems moving from CPUs, it's now moving from CPUs to generative AI. So recommended systems, ad generation, custom ad generation targeting ads at very large scale and quite hyper targeting search and user-generated content. These are all very large-scale applications have now evolved to generative AI. Of course, the number of generative AI startups is generating tens of billions of dollars of cloud renting opportunities for our cloud partners and sovereign AI. Countries that are now realizing that their data is their natural and national resource and they have to use -- they have to use AI, build their own AI infrastructure so that they could have their own digital intelligence. Enterprise AI, as Colette mentioned earlier, is starting and you might have seen our announcement that the world's leading IT companies are joining us to take the NVIDIA AI enterprise platform to the world's enterprises. The companies that we're talking to. So many of them are just so incredibly excited to drive more productivity out of their company. And then I -- and then General Robotics. The big transformation last year as we are able to now learn physical AI from watching video and human demonstration and synthetic data generation from reinforcement learning from systems like Omniverse. We are now able to work with just about every robotics companies now to start thinking about start building on general robotics. And so you can see that there are just so many different directions that generative AI is going. And so we're actually seeing the momentum of generative AI accelerating."},{"speaker":"Colette Kress","text":"And Toshiya, to answer your question regarding sovereign AI and our goals in terms of growth, in terms of revenue, it certainly is a unique and growing opportunity, something that surfaced with generative AI and the desires of countries around the world to have their own generative AI that would be able to incorporate their own language, incorporate their own culture, incorporate their own data in that country. So more and more excitement around these models and what they can be specific for those countries. So yes, we are seeing some growth opportunity in front of us."},{"speaker":"Operator","text":"And your next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open."},{"speaker":"Joe Moore","text":"Great. Thank you. Jensen, in the press release, you talked about Blackwell anticipation being incredible, but it seems like Hopper demand is also really strong. I mean, you're guiding for a very strong quarter without Blackwell in October. So how long do you see sort of coexisting strong demand for both? And can you talk about the transition to Blackwell? Do you see people intermixing clusters? Do you think most of the Blackwell activity is new clusters? Just some sense of what that transition looks like?"},{"speaker":"Jensen Huang","text":"Yes. Thanks, Joe. The demand for Hopper is really strong and it's true. The demand for Blackwell is incredible. There's a couple of reasons for that. The first reason is, if you just look at the world's cloud service providers and the amount of GPU capacity they have available, it's basically none. And the reason for that is because they're either being deployed internally for accelerating their own workloads, data processing, for example. Data processing, we hardly ever talk about it because it's mundane. It's not very cool because it doesn't generate a picture or generate words, but almost every single company in the world processes data in the background. And NVIDIA's GPUs are the only accelerators on the planet that process and accelerate data. SQL data, Pandas data science, toolkits like Pandas and the new one, Polars, these are the most popular data processing platforms in the world. And aside from CPUs, which as I've mentioned before, really running out of steam, Nvidia's accelerated computing is really the only way to get boosting performance out of that. And so that's number one is the primary -- the number one use-case long before generative AI came along is the migration of applications one after another to accelerated computing. The second is, of course, the rentals. Their renting capacity to model makers or renting it to startup companies and a generative AI company spends the vast majority of their invested capital into infrastructure so that they could use an AI to help them create products. And so these companies need it now. They just simply can't afford -- you just raise money, you -- they want you to put it to use now. You have processing that you have to do. You can't do it next year, you got to do it today. And so there's a fair -- that's one reason. The second reason for Hopper demand right now is because of the race to the next plateau. So the first person to the next plateau, it gets to be -- gets to introduce a revolutionary level of AI. So the second person who gets there is incrementally better or about the same. And so the ability to systematically and consistently race to the next plateau and be the first one there, is how you establish leadership. NVIDIA is constantly doing that and we show that to the world and the GPUs we make and AI factories that we make, the networking systems that we make, the SOCs we create. I mean, we want to set the pace. We want to be consistently the world's best. And that's the reason why, we drive ourselves so hard. And of course, we also want to see our dreams come true, and all of the capabilities that we imagine in the future, and the benefits that we can bring to society. We want to see all that come true. And so these model makers are the same. They're -- of course, they want to be the world's best, they want to be the world's first. And although Blackwell will start shipping out in billions of dollars at the end of this year, the standing up of the capacity is still probably weeks and a month or so away. And so between now and then is a lot of generative AI market dynamic. And so everybody is just really in a hurry. It's either operational reasons that they need it, they need accelerated computing. They don't want to build any more general-purpose computing infrastructure and even Hopper, you know, of course, H200 state-of-the-art. Hopper, if you have a choice between building CPU infrastructure right now for business or Hopper infrastructure for business right now, that decision is relatively clear. And so I think people are just clamoring to transition the trillion dollars of established installed infrastructure to a modern infrastructure in Hopper's state-of-the-art."},{"speaker":"Operator","text":"And your next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay with TD Cowen. Your line is open."},{"speaker":"Matt Ramsay","text":"Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everybody. I wanted to kind of circle back to an earlier question about the debate that investors are having about, I don't know, the ROI on all of this CapEx, and hopefully this question and the distinction will make some sense. But what I'm having discussions about is with like the percentage of folks that you see that are spending all of this money and looking to sort of push the frontier towards AGI convergence and as you just said, a new plateau and capability. And they're going to spend regardless to get to that level of capability because it opens up so many doors for the industry and for their company versus customers that are really, really focused today on CapEx versus ROI. I don't know if that distinction makes sense. I'm just trying to get a sense of how you're seeing the priorities of people that are putting the dollars in the ground on this new technology and what their priorities are and their time frames are for that investment? Thanks."},{"speaker":"Jensen Huang","text":"Thanks, Matt. The people who are investing in NVIDIA infrastructure are getting returns on it right away. It's the best ROI infrastructure -- computing infrastructure investment you can make today. And so one way to think through it, probably the most -- the easiest way to think through is just go back to first principles. You have trillion dollars’ worth of general-purpose computing infrastructure and the question is, do you want to build more of that or not? And for every $1 billion worth of general CPU-based infrastructure that you stand up, you probably rent it for less than $1 billion. And so because it's commoditized. There's already a trillion dollars on the ground. What's the point of getting more? And so the people who are clamoring to get this infrastructure, one, when they build-out Hopper-based infrastructure and soon Blackwell-based infrastructure, they start saving money. That's tremendous return on investment. And the reason why they start saving money is because data processing saves money, data processing is pricing, just a giant part of it already. And so recommended system save money, so on and so forth, okay? And so you start saving money. The second thing is everything you stand-up are going to get rented because so many companies are being founded to create generative AI. And so your capacity gets rented right away and the return on investment of that is really good. And then the third reason is your own business. Do you want to either create the next frontier yourself or your own Internet services benefit from a next-generation ad system or a next-generation recommended system or next-generation search system? So for your own services, for your own stores, for your own user-generated content, social media platforms for your own services, generative AI is also a fast ROI. And so there's a lot of ways you could think through it. But at the core, it's because it is the best computing infrastructure you could put in the ground today. The world of general-purpose computing is shifting to accelerated computing. The world of human-engineered software is moving to generative AI software. If you were to build infrastructure to modernize your cloud and your data centers, build it with accelerated computing NVIDIA. That's the best way to do it."},{"speaker":"Operator","text":"And your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Your line is open."},{"speaker":"Timothy Arcuri","text":"Thanks a lot. I had a question on the shape of the revenue growth both near and longer-term. I know, Colette, you did increase OpEx for the year. And if I look at the increase in your purchase commitments and your supply obligations, that's also quite bullish. On the other hand, there's some school of thought that not that many customers really seem ready for liquid cooling and I do recognize that some of these racks can be air-cooled. But Jensen, is that something to consider sort of on the shape of how Blackwell is going to ramp? And then I guess when you look beyond next year, which is obviously going to be a great year and you look into '26, do you worry about any other gating factors like, say, the power, supply-chain or at some point, models start to get smaller? I'm just wondering if you could speak to that? Thanks."},{"speaker":"Jensen Huang","text":"I'm going to work backwards. I really appreciate the question, Tim. So remember, the world is moving from general purpose computing to accelerated computing. And the world builds about $1 trillion dollars’ worth of data centers -- $1 trillion dollars’ worth of data centers in a few years will be all accelerated computing. In the past, no GPUs are in data centers, just CPUs. In the future, every single data center will have GPUs. And the reason for that is very clear is because we need to accelerate workloads so that we can continue to be sustainable, continue to drive down the cost of computing so that when we do more computing our -- we don't experience computing inflation. Second, we need GPUs for a new computing model called generative AI that we can all acknowledge is going to be quite transformative to the future of computing. And so I think working backwards, the way to think about that is the next trillion dollars of the world's infrastructure will clearly be different than the last trillion, and it will be vastly accelerated. With respect to the shape of our ramp, we offer multiple configurations of Blackwell. Blackwell comes in either a Blackwell classic, if you will, that uses the HGX form factor that we pioneered with Volta, and I think it was Volta. And so we've been shipping the HGX form factor for some time. It is air-cooled. The Grace Blackwell is liquid-cooled. However, the number of data centers that want to go liquid-cooled is quite significant. And the reason for that is because we can in a liquid-cooled data center, in any data center -- power limited data center, whatever size data center you choose, you could install and deploy anywhere from 3 times to 5 times, the AI throughput compared to the past. And so liquid cooling is cheaper, liquid cooling TCO is better, and liquid cooling allows you to have the benefit of this capability we call NVLink , which allows us to expand it to 72 Grace Blackwell packages, which has essentially 144 GPUs. And so imagine 144 GPUs connected in NVLink and that is -- we're increasingly showing you the benefits of that. And the next click is obviously a very low-latency, very-high throughput, large language model inference. And the large domain is going to be a game-changer for that. And so I think people are very comfortable deploying both. And so almost every CSP we're working with are deploying some of both. And so I -- I'm pretty confident that we'll ramp it up just fine. Your second question out of the third is that looking-forward, yes, next year is going to be a great year. We expect to grow our data center business quite significantly next year. Blackwell is going to be going to be a complete game-changer for the industry. And Blackwell is going to carry into the following year. And as I mentioned earlier, working backwards from first principles. Remember that computing is going through two platform transitions at the same time and that's just really, really important to keep your head on -- your mind focused on, which is general-purpose computing is shifting to accelerated computing and human engineered software is going to transition to generative AI or artificial intelligence learned software."},{"speaker":"Operator","text":"And your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Your line is open."},{"speaker":"Stacy Rasgon","text":"Hi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two short questions for Colette. The first, several billion dollars of Blackwell revenue in Q4. I guess is that additive? You said you expected Hopper demand to strengthen in the second half. Does that mean Hopper strengthens Q3 to Q4 as well on top of Blackwell adding several billion dollars? And the second question on gross margins, if I have mid-70s for the year, explaining where I want to draw that. If I have 75% for the year, I'd be something like 71% to 72% for Q4 somewhere in that range. Is that the kind of exit rate for gross margins that you're expecting? And how should we think about the drivers of gross margin evolution into next year as Blackwell ramps? And I mean, hopefully, I guess the yields and the inventory reserves and everything come up."},{"speaker":"Colette Kress","text":"Yes. So Stacy, let's first take your question that you had about Hopper and Blackwell. So we believe our Hopper will continue to grow into the second half. We have many new products for Hopper, our existing products for Hopper that we believe will start continuing to ramp, in the next quarters, including our Q3 and those new products moving to Q4. So let's say Hopper there for versus H1 is a growth opportunity for that. Additionally, we have the Blackwell on top of that, and the Blackwell starting of -- ramping in Q4. So hope that helps you on those two pieces. Your second piece is in terms of on our gross margin. We provided gross margin for our Q3. We provided our gross margin on a non-GAAP at about 75%. We'll work with all the different transitions that we're going through, but we do believe we can do that 75% in Q3. We provided that we're still on track for the full-year also in the mid-70s or approximately the 75%. So we're going to see some slight difference possibly in Q4. Again, with our transitions and the different cost structures that we have on our new product introductions. However, I'm not in the same number that you are there. We don't have exactly guidance, but I do believe you're lower than where we are."},{"speaker":"Operator","text":"And your next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes with Melius. Your line is open."},{"speaker":"Ben Reitzes","text":"Yes, hey, thanks a lot for the question, Jensen and Colette. I wanted to ask about the geographies. There was the 10-Q that came out and the United States was down sequentially while several Asian geographies were up a lot sequentially. Just wondering what the dynamics are there? Obviously, China did very well. You mentioned it in your remarks, what are the puts and takes? And then I just wanted to clarify from Stacy's question, if that means the sequential overall revenue growth rates for the company accelerate in the fourth quarter given all those favorable revenue dynamics? Thanks."},{"speaker":"Colette Kress","text":"Let me talk about a bit in terms of our disclosure in terms of the 10-Q, a required disclosure, and a choice of geographies. Very challenging sometimes to create that right disclosure as we have to come up with one key piece. Piece is in terms of we have in terms of who we sell to and/or specifically who we invoice to. And so what you're seeing in terms of there is who we invoice. That's not necessarily where the product will eventually be, and where it may even travel to the end-customer. These are just moving to our OEMs, our ODMs, and our system integrators for the most part across our product portfolio. So what you're seeing there is sometimes just a swift shift in terms of who they are using to complete their full configuration before those things are going into the data center, going into notebooks and those pieces of it. And that shift happens from time-to-time. But yes, our China number there are inverse into China, keep in mind that is incorporating both gaming, also data center, also automotive in those numbers that we have. Going back to your statement in regarding gross margin and also what we're seeing in terms of what we're looking at for Hopper and Blackwell in terms of revenue. Hopper will continue to grow in the second half. We'll continue to grow from what we are currently seeing. During -- determining that exact mix in each Q3 and Q4, we don't have here. We are not here to guide yet in terms of Q4. But we do see right now the demand expectations. We do see the visibility that will be a growth opportunity in Q4. On top of that, we will have our Blackwell architecture."},{"speaker":"Operator","text":"And your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open."},{"speaker":"C.J. Muse","text":"Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. You've embarked on a remarkable annual product cadence with challenges only likely becoming more and more given rising complexity and a radical limit in advanced package world. So curious, if you take a step back, how does this backdrop alter your thinking around potentially greater vertical integration, supply chain partnerships and then thinking through consequential impact to your margin profile? Thank you."},{"speaker":"Jensen Huang","text":"Yes, thanks. Let's see. I think the first answer to your -- the answer to your first question is that the reason why our velocity is so high is simultaneously because, the complexity of the model is growing and we want to continue to drive its cost down. It's growing, so we want to continue to increase its scale. And we believe that by continuing to scale the AI models that will reach a level of extraordinary usefulness and that it would open up, I realize the next industrial revolution. We believe it. And so we're going to drive ourselves really hard to continue to go up that scale. We have the ability fairly uniquely to integrate -- to design an AI factory because we have all the parts. It's not possible to come up with a new AI factory every year, unless you have all the parts. And so we have -- next year, we're going to ship a lot more CPUs than we've ever had in the history of our company, more GPUs, of course, but also NVLink switches, CX DPUs, ConnectX EPU for East and West, Bluefield DPUs for North and South and data and storage processing to InfiniBand for supercomputing centers to Ethernet, which is a brand-new product for us, which is well on its way to becoming a multi-billion dollar business to bring AI to Ethernet. And so the fact that we could build -- we have access to all of this. We have one architectural stack, as you know. It allows us to introduce new capabilities to the market as we complete it. Otherwise, what happens is, you ship these parts, you go find customers to sell it to and then you've got to build -- somebody has got to build up an AI factory. And the AI factory has got a mountain of software. And so it's not about who integrates it. We love the fact that our supply chain is disintegrated in the sense that we could service Quanta, Foxconn, HP, Dell, Lenovo, Supermicro. We used to be able to serve as ZT. They were recently purchased and so on and so forth. And so the number of ecosystem partners that we have, Gigabyte, ASUS, the number of ecosystem partners that we have that allows us allows us to -- allows them to take our architecture, which all works, but integrated in a bespoke way into all of the world's cloud service providers, enterprise data centers. The scale and reach necessary from our ODMs and our integrator supply-chain is vast and gigantic because the world is huge. And so that part we don't want to do and we're not good at doing. And I -- but we know how to design the AI infrastructure, provided the way that customers would like it and lets the ecosystem integrate it. Well, yes. So anyways, that's the reason why."},{"speaker":"Operator","text":"And your final question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Your line is open."},{"speaker":"Aaron Rakers","text":"Yes, thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to go back into the Blackwell product cycle. One of the questions that we tend to get asked is how you see the Rack Scale system mix dynamic as you think about leveraging NVLink? You think about GB, NVL72, and how that go-to-market dynamic looks as far as the Blackwell product cycle? I guess put this distinctly, how do you see that mix of Rack Scale systems as we start to think about the Blackwell cycle playing out?"},{"speaker":"Jensen Huang","text":"Yes, Aaron, thanks. The Blackwell Rack system, it's designed and architected as a rack, but it's sold, in a disaggregated system components. We don't sell the whole rack. And the reason for that is because everybody's rack is a little different, surprisingly. You know, some of them are OCP standards, some of them are not, some of them are enterprise, and the power limits for everybody could be a little different. Choice of CDUs, the choice of power bus bars, the configuration and integration into people's data centers, all different. And so the way we designed it, we architected the whole rack. The software is going to work perfectly across the whole rack. And then we provide the system components, like for example, the CPU and GPU compute board is then integrated into an MGX, it's a modular system architecture. MGX is completely ingenious. And we have MGX ODMs and integrators and OEMs all over the plant. And so just about any configuration you would like, where you would like that 3,000 pound rack to be delivered. It's got to be close to -- it has to be integrated and assembled close to the data center because it's fairly heavy. And so everything from the supply chain from the moment that we ship the GPU, CPUs, the switches, the NICs. From that point forward, the integration is done quite close to the location of the CSPs and the locations of the data centers. And so you can imagine how many data centers in the world there are and how many logistics hubs, we've scaled out to with our ODM partners. And so I think that because we show it as one rack and because it's always rendered that way and shown that way, we might have left the impression that we're doing the integration. Our customers hate that we do integration. The supply-chain hates us doing integration. They want to do the integration. That's their value-added. There's a final design in, if you will. It's not quite as simple as shimmy into a data center, but the design fit in is really complicated. And so the install -- the design fit-in, the installation, the bring-up, the repair and replace, that entire cycle is done all over the world. And we have a sprawling network of ODM and OEM partners that does this incredibly well. So integration is not the reason why we're doing racks. It's the anti-reason of doing it. The way we don't want to be an integrator. We want to be a technology provider."},{"speaker":"Operator","text":"And I will now turn the call back over to Jensen Huang for closing remarks."},{"speaker":"Jensen Huang","text":"Thank you. Let me make a couple more -- make a couple of comments that I made earlier again. That data center worldwide are in full steam to modernize the entire computing stack with accelerated computing and generative AI. Hopper demand remains strong and the anticipation for Blackwell is incredible. Let me highlight the top-five things, the top-five things of our company. Accelerated computing has reached a tipping point, CPU scaling slows, developers must accelerate everything possible. Accelerated computing starts with CUDA-X libraries. New libraries open new markets for NVIDIA. We released many new libraries, including accelerated Polars, Pandas, and Spark, the leading data science and data processing libraries, QVS for vector product vector databases. This is incredibly hot right now. Aerial and Sionna for 5G wireless base station, a whole suite of -- a whole world of data centers that we can go into now. Parabricks for gene sequencing and Alpha-fold two for protein structure prediction is now CUDA accelerated. We are at the beginning of our journey to modernize a $1 trillion dollars’ worth of data centers from general-purpose computing to accelerated computing. That's number-one. Number two, Blackwell is a step-function leap over Hopper. Blackwell is an AI infrastructure platform, not just a GPU. It also happens to be in the name of our GPU, but it's an AI infrastructure platform. As we reveal more of Blackwell and sample systems to our partners and customers, the extent of Blackwell's lead becomes clear. The Blackwell Vision took nearly five years and seven one-of-a-kind chips to realize. The Grace CPU, the Blackwell dual GPU, and a coVS package, ConnectX DPU for East-West traffic, BlueField DPU for North-South and storage traffic, NVLink switch for all-to-all GPU communications, and Quantum and Spectrum-X for both InfiniBand and Ethernet can support the massive burst traffic of AI. Blackwell AI factories are building-sized computers. NVIDIA designed and optimized the Blackwell platform full stack end-to-end from chips, systems, networking, even structured cables, power and cooling, and mounts of software to make it fast for customers to build AI factories. These are very capital-intensive infrastructures. Customers want to deploy it as soon as they get their hands on the equipment and deliver the best performance and TCO. Blackwell provides 3 times to 5 times more AI throughput in a power-limited data center than Hopper. The third is NVLink. This is a very big deal with its all-to-all GPU switch is game-changing. The Blackwell system lets us connect 144 GPUs in 72-GB 200 packages into one NVLink domain, with an aggregate NVLink bandwidth of 259 terabytes per second in one rack. Just to put that in perspective, that's about 10 times higher than Hopper, 259 terabytes per second, it kind of makes sense because you need to boost the training of multi-trillion parameter models on trillions of tokens. And so that natural amount of data needs to be moved around from GPU to GPU. For inference, NVLink is vital for low-latency, high-throughput, large language model, token generation. We now have three networking platforms, NVLink for GPU scale-up, Quantum InfiniBand for supercomputing and dedicated AI factories, and Spectrum-X for AI on Ethernet. NVIDIA's networking footprint is much bigger than before. Generative AI momentum is accelerating. Generative AI frontier model makers are racing to scale to the next AI plateau to increase model safety and IQ. We're also scaling to understand more modalities from text, images, and video to 3D, physics, chemistry, and biology. Chatbots, coding AIs, and image generators are growing fast, but it's just the tip of the iceberg. Internet services are deploying generative AI for large-scale recommenders, ad targeting, and search systems. AI start-ups are consuming tens of billions of dollars yearly of CSP's cloud capacity and countries are recognizing the importance of AI and investing in sovereign AI infrastructure. And NVIDIA AI and NVIDIA Omniverse is opening up the next era of AI general robotics. And now the enterprise AI wave has started and we're poised to help companies transform their businesses. The NVIDIA AI Enterprise platform consists of NeMo, NIMS, NIM agent blueprints, and AI Foundry, that our ecosystem partners the world-leading IT companies used to help customer -- companies customize AI models and build bespoke AI applications. Enterprises can then deploy on NVIDIA AI Enterprise runtime and at $4,500 per GPU per year, NVIDIA AI Enterprise is an exceptional value for deploying AI anywhere. And for NVIDIA's software TAM can be significant as the CUDA-compatible GPU installed-base grows from millions to tens of millions. And as Colette mentioned, NVIDIA software will exit the year at a $2 billion run rate.

Q1 was another record quarter. Revenue of $26 billion was up 18% sequentially and up 262% year-on-year and well above our outlook of $24 billion. Starting with Data Center. Data Center revenue of $22.6 billion was a record, up 23% sequentially and up 427% year-on-year, driven by continued strong demand for the NVIDIA Hopper GPU computing platform. Compute revenue grew more than 5x and networking revenue more than 3x from last year. Strong sequential data center growth was driven by all customer types, led by enterprise and consumer internet companies. Large cloud providers continue to drive strong growth as they deploy and ramp NVIDIA AI infrastructure at scale and represented the mid-40s as a percentage of our Data Center revenue. Training and inferencing AI on NVIDIA CUDA is driving meaningful acceleration in cloud rental revenue growth, delivering an immediate and strong return on cloud provider's investment. For every $1 spent on NVIDIA AI infrastructure, cloud providers have an opportunity to earn $5 in GPU instant hosting revenue over four years. NVIDIA's rich software stack and ecosystem and tight integration with cloud providers makes it easy for end customers up and running on NVIDIA GPU instances in the public cloud. For cloud rental customers, NVIDIA GPUs offer the best time to train models, the lowest cost to train models and the lowest cost to inference large language models. For public cloud providers, NVIDIA brings customers to their cloud, driving revenue growth and returns on their infrastructure investments. Leading LLM companies such as OpenAI, Adept, Anthropic, Character.AI, Cohere, Databricks, DeepMind, Meta, Mistral, xAI, and many others are building on NVIDIA AI in the cloud. Enterprises drove strong sequential growth in Data Center this quarter. We supported Tesla's expansion of their training AI cluster to 35,000 H100 GPUs. Their use of NVIDIA AI infrastructure paved the way for the breakthrough performance of FSD Version 12, their latest autonomous driving software based on Vision. Video Transformers, while consuming significantly more computing, are enabling dramatically better autonomous driving capabilities and propelling significant growth for NVIDIA AI infrastructure across the automotive industry. We expect automotive to be our largest enterprise vertical within Data Center this year, driving a multibillion revenue opportunity across on-prem and cloud consumption. Consumer Internet companies are also a strong growth vertical. A big highlight this quarter was Meta's announcement of Llama 3, their latest large language model, which was trained on a cluster of 24,000 H100 GPUs. Llama 3 powers Meta AI, a new AI assistant available on Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger. Llama 3 is openly available and has kickstarted a wave of AI development across industries. As generative AI makes its way into more consumer Internet applications, we expect to see continued growth opportunities as inference scales both with model complexity as well as with the number of users and number of queries per user, driving much more demand for AI compute. In our trailing four quarters, we estimate that inference drove about 40% of our Data Center revenue. Both training and inference are growing significantly. Large clusters like the ones built by Meta and Tesla are examples of the essential infrastructure for AI production, what we refer to as AI factories. These next-generation data centers host advanced full-stack accelerated computing platforms where the data comes in and intelligence comes out. In Q1, we worked with over 100 customers building AI factories ranging in size from hundreds to tens of thousands of GPUs, with some reaching 100,000 GPUs. From a geographic perspective, Data Center revenue continues to diversify as countries around the world invest in Sovereign AI. Sovereign AI refers to a nation's capabilities to produce artificial intelligence using its own infrastructure, data, workforce and business networks. Nations are building up domestic computing capacity through various models. Some are procuring and operating Sovereign AI clouds in collaboration with state-owned telecommunication providers or utilities. Others are sponsoring local cloud partners to provide a shared AI computing platform for public and private sector use. For example, Japan plans to invest more than $740 million in key digital infrastructure providers, including KDDI, Sakura Internet, and SoftBank to build out the nation's Sovereign AI infrastructure. France-based, Scaleway, a subsidiary of the Iliad Group, is building Europe's most powerful cloud native AI supercomputer. In Italy, Swisscom Group will build the nation's first and most powerful NVIDIA DGX-powered supercomputer to develop the first LLM natively trained in the Italian language. And in Singapore, the National Supercomputer Center is getting upgraded with NVIDIA Hopper GPUs, while Singtel is building NVIDIA's accelerated AI factories across Southeast Asia. NVIDIA's ability to offer end-to-end compute to networking technologies, full-stack software, AI expertise, and rich ecosystem of partners and customers allows Sovereign AI and regional cloud providers to jumpstart their country's AI ambitions. From nothing the previous year, we believe Sovereign AI revenue can approach the high single-digit billions this year. The importance of AI has caught the attention of every nation. We ramped new products designed specifically for China that don't require an export control license. Our Data Center revenue in China is down significantly from the level prior to the imposition of the new export control restrictions in October. We expect the market in China to remain very competitive going forward. From a product perspective, the vast majority of compute revenue was driven by our Hopper GPU architecture. Demand for Hopper during the quarter continues to increase. Thanks to CUDA algorithm innovations, we've been able to accelerate LLM inference on H100 by up to 3x, which can translate to a 3x cost reduction for serving popular models like Llama 3. We started sampling the H200 in Q1 and are currently in production with shipments on track for Q2. The first H200 system was delivered by Jensen to Sam Altman and the team at OpenAI and powered their amazing GPT-4o demos last week. H200 nearly doubles the inference performance of H100, delivering significant value for production deployments. For example, using Llama 3 with 700 billion parameters, a single NVIDIA HGX H200 server can deliver 24,000 tokens per second, supporting more than 2,400 users at the same time. That means for every $1 spent on NVIDIA HGX H200 servers at current prices per token, an API provider serving Llama 3 tokens can generate $7 in revenue over four years. With ongoing software optimizations, we continue to improve the performance of NVIDIA AI infrastructure for serving AI models. While supply for H100 prove, we are still constrained on H200. At the same time, Blackwell is in full production. We are working to bring up our system and cloud partners for global availability later this year. Demand for H200 and Blackwell is well ahead of supply and we expect demand may exceed supply well into next year. Grace Hopper Superchip is shipping in volume. Last week at the International Supercomputing Conference, we announced that nine new supercomputers worldwide are using Grace Hopper for a combined 200 exaflops of energy-efficient AI processing power delivered this year. These include the Alps Supercomputer at the Swiss National Supercomputing Center, the fastest AI supercomputer in Europe. Isambard-AI at the University of Bristol in the UK and JUPITER in the Julich Supercomputing Center in Germany. We are seeing an 80% attach rate of Grace Hopper in supercomputing due to its high energy efficiency and performance. We are also proud to see supercomputers powered with Grace Hopper take the number one, the number two, and the number three spots of the most energy-efficient supercomputers in the world. Strong networking year-on-year growth was driven by InfiniBand. We experienced a modest sequential decline, which was largely due to the timing of supply, with demand well ahead of what we were able to ship. We expect networking to return to sequential growth in Q2. In the first quarter, we started shipping our new Spectrum-X Ethernet networking solution optimized for AI from the ground up. It includes our Spectrum-4 switch, BlueField-3 DPU, and new software technologies to overcome the challenges of AI on Ethernet to deliver 1.6x higher networking performance for AI processing compared with traditional Ethernet. Spectrum-X is ramping in volume with multiple customers, including a massive 100,000 GPU cluster. Spectrum-X opens a brand-new market to NVIDIA networking and enables Ethernet only data centers to accommodate large-scale AI. We expect Spectrum-X to jump to a multibillion-dollar product line within a year. At GTC in March, we launched our next-generation AI factory platform, Blackwell. The Blackwell GPU architecture delivers up to 4x faster training and 30x faster inference than the H100 and enables real-time generative AI on trillion-parameter large language models. Blackwell is a giant leap with up to 25x lower TCO and energy consumption than Hopper. The Blackwell platform includes the fifth-generation NVLink with a multi-GPU spine and new InfiniBand and Ethernet switches, the X800 series designed for a trillion parameter scale AI. Blackwell is designed to support data centers universally, from hyperscale to enterprise, training to inference, x86 to Grace CPUs, Ethernet to InfiniBand networking, and air cooling to liquid cooling. Blackwell will be available in over 100 OEM and ODM systems at launch, more than double the number of Hopper's launch and representing every major computer maker in the world. This will support fast and broad adoption across the customer types, workloads and data center environments in the first year shipments. Blackwell time-to-market customers include Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, OpenAI, Oracle, Tesla, and xAI. We announced a new software product with the introduction of NVIDIA Inference Microservices or NIM. NIM provides secure and performance-optimized containers powered by NVIDIA CUDA acceleration in network computing and inference software, including Triton Inference Server and TensorRT LLM with industry-standard APIs for a broad range of use cases, including large language models for text, speech, imaging, vision, robotics, genomics and digital biology. They enable developers to quickly build and deploy generative AI applications using leading models from NVIDIA, AI21, Adept, Cohere, Getty Images, and Shutterstock and open models from Google, Hugging Face, Meta, Microsoft, Mistral AI, Snowflake and Stability AI. NIMs will be offered as part of our NVIDIA AI enterprise software platform for production deployment in the cloud or on-prem. Moving to gaming and AI PCs. Gaming revenue of $2.65 billion was down 8% sequentially and up 18% year-on-year, consistent with our outlook for a seasonal decline. The GeForce RTX Super GPUs market reception is strong and end demand and channel inventory remained healthy across the product range. From the very start of our AI journey, we equipped GeForce RTX GPUs with CUDA Tensor Cores. Now with over 100 million of an installed base, GeForce RTX GPUs are perfect for gamers, creators, AI enthusiasts and offer unmatched performance for running generative AI applications on PCs. NVIDIA has full technology stack for deploying and running fast and efficient generative AI inference on GeForce RTX PCs. TensorRT LLM now accelerates Microsoft's Phi-3-Mini model and Google's Gemma 2B and 7B models as well as popular AI frameworks, including LangChain and LlamaIndex. Yesterday, NVIDIA and Microsoft announced AI performance optimizations for Windows to help run LLMs up to 3x faster on NVIDIA GeForce RTX AI PCs. And top game developers, including NetEase Games, Tencent and Ubisoft are embracing NVIDIA Avatar Character Engine to create lifelike avatars to transform interactions between gamers and nonplayable characters. Moving to ProVis. Revenue of $427 million was down 8% sequentially and up 45% year-on-year. We believe generative AI and Omniverse industrial digitalization will drive the next wave of professional visualization growth. At GTC, we announced new Omniverse Cloud APIs to enable developers to integrate Omniverse industrial digital twin and simulation technologies into their applications. Some of the world's largest industrial software makers are adopting these APIs, including ANSYS, Cadence, 3DEXCITE at Dassault Systemes, Brand and Siemens. And developers can use them to stream industrial digital twins with spatial computing devices such as Apple Vision Pro. Omniverse Cloud APIs will be available on Microsoft Azure later this year. Companies are using Omniverse to digitalize their workflows. Omniverse power digital twins enable Wistron, one of our manufacturing partners to reduce end-to-end production cycle times by 50% and defect rates by 40%. And BYD, the world's largest electric vehicle maker, is adopting Omniverse for virtual factory planning and retail configurations. Moving to automotive. Revenue was $329 million, up 17% sequentially and up 11% year-on-year. Sequential growth was driven by the ramp of AI cockpit solutions with global OEM customers and strength in our self-driving platforms. Year-on-year growth was driven primarily by self-driving. We supported Xiaomi in the successful launch of its first electric vehicle, the SU7 sedan built on the NVIDIA DRIVE Orin, our AI car computer for software-defined AV fleets. We also announced a number of new design wins on NVIDIA DRIVE Thor, the successor to Orin, powered by the new NVIDIA Blackwell architecture with several leading EV makers, including BYD, XPeng, GAC's Aion Hyper and Neuro. DRIVE Thor is slated for production vehicles starting next year. Okay. Moving to the rest of the P&L. GAAP gross margin expanded sequentially to 78.4% and non-GAAP gross margins to 78.9% on lower inventory targets. As noted last quarter, both Q4 and Q1 benefited from favorable component costs. Sequentially, GAAP operating expenses were up 10% and non-GAAP operating expenses were up 13%, primarily reflecting higher compensation-related costs and increased compute and infrastructure investments. In Q1, we returned $7.8 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and cash dividends. Today, we announced a 10-for-1 split of our shares with June 10th as the first day of trading on a split-adjusted basis. We are also increasing our dividend by 150%. Let me turn to the outlook for the second quarter. Total revenue is expected to be $28 billion, plus or minus 2%. We expect sequential growth in all market platforms. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 74.8% and 75.5%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points, consistent with our discussion last quarter. For the full year, we expect gross margins to be in the mid-70s percent range. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $4 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively. Full year OpEx is expected to grow in the low 40% range. GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are expected to be an income of approximately, excuse me, approximately $300 million, excluding gains and losses from nonaffiliated investments. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 17%, plus or minus 1%, excluding any discrete items. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website. I would like to now turn it over to Jensen as he would like to make a few comments."},{"speaker":"Jensen Huang","text":"Thanks, Colette. The industry is going through a major change. Before we start Q&A, let me give you some perspective on the importance of the transformation. The next industrial revolution has begun. Companies and countries are partnering with NVIDIA to shift the trillion-dollar installed base of traditional data centers to accelerated computing and build a new type of data center, AI factories, to produce a new commodity, artificial intelligence. AI will bring significant productivity gains to nearly every industry and help companies be more cost and energy efficient while expanding revenue opportunities. CSPs were the first generative AI movers. With NVIDIA, CSPs accelerated workloads to save money and power. The tokens generated by NVIDIA Hopper drive revenues for their AI services. And NVIDIA cloud instances attract rental customers from our rich ecosystem of developers. Strong and accelerated demand -- accelerating demand for generative AI training and inference on Hopper platform propels our Data Center growth. Training continues to scale as models learn to be multimodal, understanding text, speech, images, video and 3D and learn to reason and plan. Our inference workloads are growing incredibly. With generative AI, inference, which is now about fast token generation at massive scale, has become incredibly complex. Generative AI is driving a from-foundation-up full stack computing platform shift that will transform every computer interaction. From today's information retrieval model, we are shifting to an answers and skills generation model of computing. AI will understand context and our intentions, be knowledgeable, reason, plan and perform tasks. We are fundamentally changing how computing works and what computers can do, from general purpose CPU to GPU accelerated computing, from instruction-driven software to intention-understanding models, from retrieving information to performing skills, and at the industrial level, from producing software to generating tokens, manufacturing digital intelligence. Token generation will drive a multiyear build-out of AI factories. Beyond cloud service providers, generative AI has expanded to consumer Internet companies and enterprise, Sovereign AI, automotive, and health care customers, creating multiple multibillion-dollar vertical markets. The Blackwell platform is in full production and forms the foundation for trillion-parameter scale generative AI. The combination of Grace CPU, Blackwell GPUs, NVLink, Quantum, Spectrum, mix and switches, high-speed interconnects and a rich ecosystem of software and partners let us expand and offer a richer and more complete solution for AI factories than previous generations. Spectrum-X opens a brand-new market for us to bring large-scale AI to Ethernet-only data centers. And NVIDIA NIMs is our new software offering that delivers enterprise-grade optimized generative AI to run on CUDA everywhere, from the cloud to on-prem data centers to RTX AI PCs through our expansive network of ecosystem partners. From Blackwell to Spectrum-X to NIMs, we are poised for the next wave of growth. Thank you."},{"speaker":"Simona Jankowski","text":"Thank you, Jensen. We will now open the call for questions. Operator, could you please poll for questions?"}],"qanda":[{"speaker":"Operator","text":"[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein. Please go ahead."},{"speaker":"Stacy Rasgon","text":"Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. My first one, I wanted to drill a little bit into the Blackwell comment that it's in full production now. What does that suggest with regard to shipments and delivery timing if that product is -- doesn't sound like it's sampling anymore. What does that mean when that's actually in customers' hands if it's in production now?"},{"speaker":"Jensen Huang","text":"We will be shipping. Well, we've been in production for a little bit of time. But our production shipments will start in Q2 and ramp in Q3, and customers should have data centers stood up in Q4."},{"speaker":"Stacy Rasgon","text":"Got it. So this year, we will see Blackwell revenue, it sounds like?"},{"speaker":"Jensen Huang","text":"We will see a lot of Blackwell revenue this year."},{"speaker":"Operator","text":"Our next question will come from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Please go ahead."},{"speaker":"Timothy Arcuri","text":"Thanks a lot. I wanted to ask, Jensen, about the deployment of Blackwell versus Hopper just between the systems nature and all the demand for GB that you have. How does the deployment of this stuff differ from Hopper? I guess I ask because liquid cooling at scale hasn't been done before, and there's some engineering challenges both at the node level and within the data center. So do these complexities sort of elongate the transition? And how do you sort of think about how that's all going? Thanks."},{"speaker":"Jensen Huang","text":"Yes. Blackwell comes in many configurations. Blackwell is a platform, not a GPU. And the platform includes support for air cooled, liquid cooled, x86 and Grace, InfiniBand, now Spectrum-X and very large NVLink domain that I demonstrated at GTC, that I showed at GTC. And so for some customers, they will ramp into their existing installed base of data centers that are already shipping Hoppers. They will easily transition from H100 to H200 to B100. And so Blackwell systems have been designed to be backwards compatible, if you will, electrically, mechanically. And of course, the software stack that runs on Hopper will run fantastically on Blackwell. We also have been priming the pump, if you will, with the entire ecosystem, getting them ready for liquid cooling. We've been talking to the ecosystem about Blackwell for quite some time. And the CSPs, the data centers, the ODMs, the system makers, our supply chain beyond them, the cooling supply chain base, liquid cooling supply chain base, data center supply chain base, no one is going to be surprised with Blackwell coming and the capabilities that we would like to deliver with Grace Blackwell 200. GB200 is going to be exceptional."},{"speaker":"Operator","text":"Our next question will come from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead."},{"speaker":"Vivek Arya","text":"Thanks for taking my question. Jensen, how are you ensuring that there is enough utilization of your products and that there isn't a pull-ahead or holding behavior because of tight supply, competition or other factors? Basically, what checks have you built in the system to give us confidence that monetization is keeping pace with your really very strong shipment growth?"},{"speaker":"Jensen Huang","text":"Well, I guess, there's the big picture view that I'll come to, and then, but I'll answer your question directly. The demand for GPUs in all the data centers is incredible. We're racing every single day. And the reason for that is because applications like ChatGPT and GPT-4o, and now it's going to be multi-modality and Gemini and its ramp and Anthropic and all of the work that's being done at all the CSPs are consuming every GPU that's out there. There's also a long line of generative AI startups, some 15,000, 20,000 startups that in all different fields from multimedia to digital characters, of course, all kinds of design tool application -- productivity applications, digital biology, the moving of the AV industry to video, so that they can train end-to-end models, to expand the operating domain of self-driving cars. The list is just quite extraordinary. We're racing actually. Customers are putting a lot of pressure on us to deliver the systems and stand it up as quickly as possible. And of course, I haven't even mentioned all of the Sovereign AIs who would like to train all of their regional natural resource of their country, which is their data to train their regional models. And there's a lot of pressure to stand those systems up. So anyhow, the demand, I think, is really, really high and it outstrips our supply. Longer term, that's what -- that's the reason why I jumped in to make a few comments. Longer term, we're completely redesigning how computers work. And this is a platform shift. Of course, it's been compared to other platform shifts in the past. But time will clearly tell that this is much, much more profound than previous platform shifts. And the reason for that is because the computer is no longer an instruction-driven only computer. It's an intention-understanding computer. And it understands, of course, the way we interact with it, but it also understands our meaning, what we intend that we asked it to do and it has the ability to reason, inference iteratively to process a plan and come back with a solution. And so every aspect of the computer is changing in such a way that instead of retrieving prerecorded files, it is now generating contextually relevant intelligent answers. And so that's going to change computing stacks all over the world. And you saw a build that, in fact, even the PC computing stack is going to get revolutionized. And this is just the beginning of all the things that -- what people see today are the beginning of the things that we're working in our labs and the things that we're doing with all the startups and large companies and developers all over the world. It's going to be quite extraordinary."},{"speaker":"Operator","text":"Our next question will come from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead."},{"speaker":"Joseph Moore","text":"Great. Thank you. I understand what you just said about how strong demand is. You have a lot of demand for H200 and for Blackwell products. Do you anticipate any kind of pause with Hopper and H100 as you sort of migrate to those products? Will people wait for those new products, which would be a good product to have? Or do you think there's enough demand for H100 to sustain growth?"},{"speaker":"Jensen Huang","text":"We see increasing demand of Hopper through this quarter. And we expect to be -- we expect demand to outstrip supply for some time as we now transition to H200, as we transition to Blackwell. Everybody is anxious to get their infrastructure online. And the reason for that is because they're saving money and making money, and they would like to do that as soon as possible."},{"speaker":"Operator","text":"Our next question will come from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead."},{"speaker":"Toshiya Hari","text":"Hi. Thank you so much for taking the question. Jensen, I wanted to ask about competition. I think many of your cloud customers have announced new or updates to their existing internal programs, right, in parallel to what they're working on with you guys. To what extent did you consider them as competitors, medium to long term? And in your view, do you think they're limited to addressing most internal workloads or could they be broader in what they address going forward? Thank you."},{"speaker":"Jensen Huang","text":"We're different in several ways. First, NVIDIA's accelerated computing architecture allows customers to process every aspect of their pipeline from unstructured data processing to prepare it for training, to structured data processing, data frame processing like SQL to prepare for training, to training to inference. And as I was mentioning in my remarks, that inference has really fundamentally changed, it's now generation. It's not trying to just detect the cat, which was plenty hard in itself, but it has to generate every pixel of a cat. And so the generation process is a fundamentally different processing architecture. And it's one of the reasons why TensorRT LLM was so well received. We improved the performance in using the same chips on our architecture by a factor of three. That kind of tells you something about the richness of our architecture and the richness of our software. So one, you could use NVIDIA for everything, from computer vision to image processing, the computer graphics to all modalities of computing. And as the world is now suffering from computing cost and computing energy inflation because general-purpose computing has run its course, accelerated computing is really the sustainable way of going forward. So accelerated computing is how you're going to save money in computing, is how you're going to save energy in computing. And so the versatility of our platform results in the lowest TCO for their data center. Second, we're in every cloud. And so for developers that are looking for a platform to develop on, starting with NVIDIA is always a great choice. And we're on-prem, we're in the cloud. We're in computers of any size and shape. We're practically everywhere. And so that's the second reason. The third reason has to do with the fact that we build AI factories. And this is becoming more an apparent to people that AI is not a chip problem only. It starts, of course, with very good chips and we build a whole bunch of chips for our AI factories, but it's a systems problem. In fact, even AI is now a systems problem. It's not just one large language model. It's a complex system of a whole bunch of large language models that are working together. And so the fact that NVIDIA builds this system causes us to optimize all of our chips to work together as a system, to be able to have software that operates as a system, and to be able to optimize across the system. And just to put it in perspective in simple numbers, if you had a $5 billion infrastructure and you improved the performance by a factor of two, which we routinely do, when you improve the infrastructure by a factor of two, the value too is $5 billion. All the chips in that data center doesn't pay for it. And so the value of it is really quite extraordinary. And this is the reason why today, performance matters everything. This is at a time when the highest performance is also the lowest cost because the infrastructure cost of carrying all of these chips cost a lot of money. And it takes a lot of money to fund the data center, to operate the data center, the people that goes along with it, the power that goes along with it, the real estate that goes along with it, and all of it adds up. And so the highest performance is also the lowest TCO."},{"speaker":"Operator","text":"Our next question will come from the line of Matt Ramsay with TD Cowen. Please go ahead."},{"speaker":"Matthew Ramsay","text":"Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everyone. Jensen, I've been in the data center industry my whole career. I've never seen the velocity that you guys are introducing new platforms at the same combination of the performance jumps that you're getting, I mean, 5x in training. Some of the stuff you talked about at GTC up to 30x in inference. And it's an amazing thing to watch but, it also creates an interesting juxtaposition where the current generation of product that your customers are spending billions of dollars on, it's going to be not as competitive with your new stuff, very, very much more quickly than the depreciation cycle of that product. So I'd like you to -- if you wouldn't mind speak a little bit about how you're seeing that situation evolve itself with customers. As you move to Blackwell, you're going to have very large installed bases, obviously software compatible, but large installed bases of product that's not nearly as performant as your new generation stuff. And it'd be interesting to hear what you see happening with customers along that path. Thank you."},{"speaker":"Jensen Huang","text":"Yes. I really appreciate it. Three points that I'd like to make. If you're 5% into the build-out versus if you're 95% into the build out, you're going to feel very differently. And because you're only 5% into the build-out anyhow, you build as fast as you can. And when Blackwell comes, it's going to be terrific. And then after Blackwell, as you mentioned, we have other Blackwells coming. And then there's a short -- we're in a one-year rhythm as we've explained to the world. And we want our customers to see our road map for as far as they like, but they're early in their build-out anyways and so they had to just keep on building, okay. And so there's going to be a whole bunch of chips coming at them, and they just got to keep on building and just, if you will, performance average your way into it. So that's the smart thing to do. They need to make money today. They want to save money today. And time is really, really valuable to them. Let me give you an example of time being really valuable, why this idea of standing up a data center instantaneously is so valuable and getting this thing called time to train is so valuable. The reason for that is because the next company who reaches the next major plateau gets to announce a groundbreaking AI. And the second one after that gets to announce something that's 0.3% better. And so the question is, do you want to be repeatedly the company delivering groundbreaking AI or the company delivering 0.3% better? And that's the reason why this race, as in all technology races, the race is so important. And you're seeing this race across multiple companies because this is so vital to have technology leadership, for companies to trust the leadership and want to build on your platform and know that the platform that they're building on is going to get better and better. And so leadership matters a great deal. Time to train matters a great deal. The difference between time to train that is three months earlier just to get it done, in order to get time to train on three-months project, getting started three months earlier is everything. And so it's the reason why we're standing up Hopper systems like mad right now because the next plateau is just around the corner. And so that's the second reason. The first comment that you made is really a great comment, which is how is it that we're doing -- we're moving so fast and advancing them quickly? Because we have all the stacks here. We literally build the entire data center and we can monitor everything, measure everything, optimize across everything. We know where all the bottlenecks are. We're not guessing about it. We're not putting up PowerPoint slides that look good. We're actually -- we also like our PowerPoint slides look good, but we're delivering systems that perform at scale. And the reason why we know they perform at scale is because we built it all here. Now one of the things that we do that's a bit of a miracle is that we build entire AI infrastructure here, but then we disaggregated and integrated into our customers' data centers however they liked. But we know how it's going to perform and we know where the bottlenecks are. We know where we need to optimize with them and we know where we have to help them improve their infrastructure to achieve the most performance. This deep intimate knowledge at the entire data center scale is fundamentally what sets us apart today. We build every single chip from the ground up. We know exactly how processing is done across the entire system. And so we understand exactly how it's going to perform and how to get the most out of it with every single generation. So I appreciate. Those are the three points."},{"speaker":"Operator","text":"Your next question will come from the line of Mark Lipacis with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead."},{"speaker":"Mark Lipacis","text":"Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Jensen, in the past, you've made the observation that general-purpose computing ecosystems typically dominated each computing era. And I believe the argument was that they could adapt to different workloads, get higher utilization, drive cost of compute cycle down. And this is a motivation for why you were driving to a general-purpose GPU CUDA ecosystem for accelerated computing. And if I mischaracterized that observation, please do let me know. So the question is, given that the workloads that are driving demand for your solutions are being driven by neural network training and inferencing, which on the surface seem like a limited number of workloads, then it might also seem to lend themselves to custom solutions. And so then the question is about does the general purpose computing framework become more at risk or is there enough variability or a rapid enough evolution on these workloads that support that historical general purpose framework? Thank you."},{"speaker":"Jensen Huang","text":"Yes. NVIDIA's accelerated computing is versatile, but I wouldn't call it general-purpose. Like for example, we wouldn't be very good at running the spreadsheet. That was really designed for general-purpose computing. And so there is a -- the control loop of an operating system code probably isn't fantastic for general-purpose compute, not for accelerated computing. And so I would say that we're versatile, and that's usually the way I describe it. There's a rich domain of applications that we're able to accelerate over the years, but they all have a lot of commonalities. Maybe some deep differences, but commonalities. They're all things that I can run in parallel, they're all heavily threaded. 5% of the code represents 99% of the run-time, for example. Those are all properties of accelerated computing. The versatility of our platform and the fact that we design entire systems is the reason why over the course of the last 10 years or so, the number of start-ups that you guys have asked me about in these conference calls is fairly large. And every single one of them, because of the brittleness of their architecture, the moment generative AI came along or the moment the fusion models came along, the moment the next models are coming along now. And now all of a sudden, look at this, large language models with memory because the large language model needs to have memory so they can carry on a conversation with you, understand the context. All of a sudden, the versatility of the Grace memory became super important. And so each one of these advances in generative AI and the advancement of AI really begs for not having a widget that's designed for one model. But to have something that is really good for this entire domain, properties of this entire domain, but obeys the first principles of software, that software is going to continue to evolve, that software is going to keep getting better and bigger. We believe in the scaling of these models. There's a lot of reasons why we're going to scale by easily a million times in the coming few years for good reasons, and we're looking forward to it and we're ready for it. And so the versatility of our platform is really quite key. And it's not -- if you're too brittle and too specific, you might as well just build an FPGA or you build an ASIC or something like that, but that's hardly a computer."},{"speaker":"Operator","text":"Our next question will come from the line of Blayne Curtis with Jefferies. Please go ahead."},{"speaker":"Blayne Curtis","text":"Thanks for taking my question. Actually kind of curious, I mean, being supply constrained, how do you think about , I mean, you came out with a product for China, H20. I'm assuming there'd be a ton of demand for it, but obviously, you're trying to serve your customers with the other Hopper products. Just kind of curious how you're thinking about that in the second half. You could elaborate any impact, what you're thinking for sales as well as gross margin."},{"speaker":"Jensen Huang","text":"I didn't hear your questions. Something bleeped out."},{"speaker":"Simona Jankowski","text":"H20 and how you're thinking about allocating supply between the different Hopper products."},{"speaker":"Jensen Huang","text":"Well, we have customers that we honor and we do our best for every customer. It is the case that our business in China is substantially lower than the levels of the past. And it's a lot more competitive in China now because of the limitations on our technology. And so those matters are true. However, we continue to do our best to serve the customers in the markets there and to the best of our ability, we'll do our best. But I think overall, the comments that we made about demand outstripping supply is for the entire market and particularly so for H200 and Blackwell towards the end of the year."},{"speaker":"Operator","text":"Our next question will come from the line of Srini Pajjuri with Raymond James. Please go ahead."},{"speaker":"Srini Pajjuri","text":"Thank you. Jensen, actually more of a clarification on what you said. GB 200 systems, it looks like there is a significant demand for systems. Historically, I think you've sold a lot of HGX boards and some GPUs and the systems business was relatively small. So I'm just curious, why is it that now you are seeing such a strong demand for systems going forward? Is it just the TCO or is it something else or is it just the architecture? Thank you."},{"speaker":"Jensen Huang","text":"Yes. I appreciate that. In fact, the way we sell GB200 is the same. We disaggregate all of the components that make sense and we integrate it into computer makers. We have 100 different computer system configurations that are coming this year for Blackwell. And that is off the charts. Hopper, frankly, had only half, but that's at its peak. It started out with way less than that even. And so you're going to see liquid cooled version, air cooled version, x86 visions, Grace versions, so on and so forth. There's a whole bunch of systems that are being designed. And they're offered from all of our ecosystem of great partners. Nothing has really changed. Now of course, the Blackwell platform has expanded our offering tremendously. The integration of CPUs and the much more compressed density of computing, liquid cooling is going to save data centers a lot of money in provisioning power and not to mention to be more energy efficient. And so it's a much better solution. It's more expansive, meaning that we offer a lot more components of a data center and everybody wins. The data center gets much higher performance, networking from networking switches, networking. Of course, NICs, we have Ethernet now so that we can bring NVIDIA AI to a large-scale NVIDIA AI to customers who only operate only know how to operate Ethernet because of the ecosystem that they have. And so Blackwell is much more expansive. We have a lot more to offer our customers this generation around."},{"speaker":"Operator","text":"Our next question will come from the line William Stein with Truist Securities. Please go ahead."},{"speaker":"William Stein","text":"Great. Thanks for taking my question. Jensen, at some point, NVIDIA decided that while there are reasonably good CPUs available for data center operations, your ARM-based Grace CPU provides some real advantage that made that technology worth delivering to customers, perhaps related to cost or power consumption or technical synergies between Grace and Hopper, Grace and Blackwell. Can you address whether there could be a similar dynamic that might emerge on the client side, whereby while there are very good solutions, you've highlighted that Intel and AMD are very good partners and deliver great products in x86, but there might be some, especially in emerging AI workloads, some advantage that NVIDIA can deliver that others have more of a challenge?"},{"speaker":"Jensen Huang","text":"Well, you mentioned some really good reasons. It is true that for many of the applications, our partnership with x86 partners are really terrific and we build excellent systems together. But Grace allows us to do something that isn't possible with the configuration, the system configuration today. The memory system between Grace and Hopper are coherent and connected. The interconnect between the two chips, calling it two chips is almost weird because it's like a superchip. The two of them are connected with this interface that's like a terabytes per second. It's off the charts. And the memory that's used by Grace is LPDDR. It's the first data center-grade low-power memory. And so we save a lot of power on every single node. And then finally, because of the architecture, because we can create our own architecture with the entire system now, we could create something that has a really large NVLink domain, which is vitally important to the next-generation large language models for inferencing. And so you saw that GB200 has a 72-node NVLink domain. That's like 72 Blackwells connected together into one giant GPU. And so we needed Grace Blackwells to be able to do that. And so there are architectural reasons, there are software programming reasons and then there are system reasons that are essential for us to build them that way. And so if we see opportunities like that, we'll explore it. And today, as you saw at the build yesterday, which I thought was really excellent, Satya announced the next-generation PCs, Copilot+ PC, which runs fantastically on NVIDIA's RTX GPUs that are shipping in laptops. But it also supports ARM beautifully. And so it opens up opportunities for system innovation even for PCs."},{"speaker":"Operator","text":"Our last question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead."},{"speaker":"C.J. Muse","text":"Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess, Jensen, a bit of a longer-term question. I know Blackwell hasn't even launched yet, but obviously, investors are forward-looking and amidst rising potential competition from GPUs and custom ASICs, how are you thinking about NVIDIA's pace of innovation and your million-fold scaling over the last decade, truly impressive. CUDA, Varsity, Precision, Grace, Cohere and Connectivity. When you look forward, what frictions need to be solved in the coming decade? And I guess, maybe more importantly, what are you willing to share with us today?"},{"speaker":"Jensen Huang","text":"Well, I can announce that after Blackwell, there's another chip. And we are on a one-year rhythm. And so and you can also count that -- count on us having new networking technology on a very fast rhythm. We're announcing Spectrum-X for Ethernet. But we're all in on Ethernet, and we have a really exciting road map coming for Ethernet. We have a rich ecosystem of partners. Dell announced that they're taking Spectrum-X to market. We have a rich ecosystem of customers and partners who are going to announce taking our entire AI factory architecture to market. And so for companies that want the ultimate performance, we have InfiniBand computing fabric. InfiniBand is a computing fabric, Ethernet is a network. And InfiniBand, over the years, started out as a computing fabric, became a better and better network. Ethernet is a network and with Spectrum-X, we're going to make it a much better computing fabric. And we're committed -- fully committed to all three links, NVLink computing fabric for single computing domain to InfiniBand computing fabric, to Ethernet networking computing fabric. And so we're going to take all three of them forward at a very fast clip. And so you're going to see new switches coming, new NICs coming, new capability, new software stacks that run on all three of them. New CPUs, new GPUs, new networking NICs, new switches, a mound of chips that are coming. And all of it, the beautiful thing is all of it runs CUDA. And all of it runs our entire software stack. So you invest today on our software stack, without doing anything at all, it's just going to get faster and faster and faster and faster. And if you invest in our architecture today, without doing anything, it will go to more and more clouds and more and more data centers and everything just runs. And so I think the pace of innovation that we're bringing will drive up the capability, on the one hand, and drive down the TCO on the other hand. And so we should be able to scale out with the NVIDIA architecture for this new era of computing and start this new industrial revolution where we manufacture not just software anymore, but we manufacture artificial intelligence tokens and we're going to do that at scale. Thank you."},{"speaker":"Operator","text":"That will conclude our question-and-answer session and our call for today.

Revenue of $22.1 billion was up 22% sequentially and up to 265% year-on-year and well above our outlook of $20 billion. For fiscal 2024, revenue was $60.9 billion and up 126% from the prior year. Starting with data center. Data center revenue for the fiscal 2024 year was $47.5 billion, more than tripling from the prior year. The world has reached the tipping point of new computing era. The $1 trillion installed base of data center infrastructure is rapidly transitioning from general purpose to accelerated computing. As Moore's Law slows while computing demand continues to skyrocket, companies may accelerate every workload possible to drive future improvement in performance, TCO and energy efficiency. At the same time, companies have started to build the next generation of modern data centers, what we refer to as AI factories, purpose built to refine raw data and produce valuable intelligence in the era of generative AI. In the fourth quarter, data center revenue of $18.4 billion was a record, up 27% sequentially and up 409% year-over-year, driven by the NVIDIA Hopper GPU computing platform along with InfiniBand end-to-end networking. Compute revenue grew more than 5x and networking revenue tripled from last year. We are delighted that supply of Hopper architecture products is improving. Demand for Hopper remains very strong. We expect our next-generation products to be supply constrained as demand far exceeds supply. Fourth quarter data center growth was driven by both training and inference of generative AI and large language models across a broad set of industries, use cases and regions. The versatility and leading performance of our data center platform enables a high return on investment for many use cases, including AI training and inference, data processing and a broad range of CUDA accelerated workloads. We estimate in the past year approximately 40% of data center revenue was for AI inference. Building and deploying AI solutions has reached virtually every industry. Many companies across industries are training and operating their AI models and services at scale, enterprises across NVIDIA AI infrastructure through cloud providers, including hyperscales, GPU specialized and private clouds or on-premise. NVIDIA's computing stack extends seamlessly across cloud and on-premise environments, allowing customers to deploy with a multi-cloud or hybrid-cloud strategy. In the fourth quarter, large cloud providers represented more than half of our data center revenue, supporting both internal workloads and external public cloud customers. Microsoft recently noted that more than 50,000 organizations use GitHub Copilot business to supercharge the productivity of their developers, contributing to GitHub revenue growth accelerating to 40% year-over-year. And Copilot for Microsoft 365 adoption grew faster in its first two months than the two previous major Microsoft 365 enterprise suite releases did. Consumer internet companies have been early adopters of AI and represent one of our largest customer categories. Companies from search to e-commerce, social media, news and video services and entertainment are using AI for deep learning-based recommendation systems. These AI investments are generating a strong return by improving customer engagement, ad conversation and click-throughs rates. Meta in its latest quarter cited more accurate predictions and improved advertiser performance as contributing to the significant acceleration in its revenue. In addition, consumer internet companies are investing in generative AI to support content creators, advertisers and customers through automation tools for content and ad creation, online product descriptions and AI shopping assistance. Enterprise software companies are applying generative AI to help customers realize productivity gains. Early customers we've partnered with for both training and inference of generative AI are already seeing notable commercial success. ServiceNow's generative AI products in their latest quarter drove their largest ever net new annual contract value contribution of any new product family release. We are working with many other leading AI and enterprise software platforms as well, including Adobe, Databricks, Getty Images, SAP and Snowflake. The field of foundation of large-language models is thriving. Anthropic, Google, Inflection, Microsoft, OpenAI and xAI are leading with continued amazing breakthrough in generative AI. Exciting companies like Adept, AI21, Character.ai, Cohere, Mistral, Perplexity and Runway are building platforms to serve enterprises and creators. New startups are creating LLMs to serve the specific languages, cultures and customs of the world many regions. And others are creating foundation models to address entirely different industries like Recursion Pharmaceuticals and Generate:Biomedicines for biology. These companies are driving demand for NVIDIA AI infrastructure through hyperscale or GPU specialized cloud providers. Just this morning, we announced that we've collaborated with Google to optimize its state-of-the art new Gemma language models to accelerate their inference performance on NVIDIA GPUs in the cloud data center and PC. One of the most notable trends over the past year is the significant adoption of AI by enterprises across the industry verticals such as automotive, healthcare and financial services. NVIDIA offers multiple application frameworks to help companies adopt AI in vertical domains such as autonomous driving, drug discovery, low latency machine learning for fraud detection or robotics, leveraging our full stack accelerated computing platform. We estimate the data center revenue contribution of the automotive vertical through the cloud or on-prem exceeded $1 billion last year. NVIDIA DRIVE infrastructure solutions includes systems and software for the development of autonomous driving, including data ingestion, creation, labeling and AI training, plus validation through simulation. Almost 80 vehicle manufacturers across global OEMs, new energy vehicles, trucking, robotaxi and Tier 1 suppliers are using NVIDIA's AI infrastructure to train LLMs and other AI models for automated driving and AI cockpit applications. And in fact, nearly every automotive company working on AI is working with NVIDIA. As AV algorithms move to video transformers and more cars are equipped with cameras, we expect NVIDIA's automotive data center processing demand to grow significantly. In healthcare, digital biology and generative AI are helping to reinvent drug discovery, surgery, medical imaging and wearable devices. We have built deep domain expertise in healthcare over the past decade, creating the NVIDIA Clara healthcare platform and NVIDIA BioNeMo, a generative AI service to develop, customize and deploy AI foundation models for computer-aided drug discovery. BioNeMo features a growing collection of pre-trained Biomolecular AI models that can be applied to the end-to-end drug discovery processes. We announced Recursion is making available for their proprietary AI model through BioNeMo for the drug discovery ecosystem. In financial services, customers are using AI for a growing set of use cases from trading and risk management to customer service and fraud detection. For example, American Express improved fraud detection accuracy by 6% using NVIDIA AI. Shifting to our data center revenue by geography. Growth was strong across all regions, except for China where our data center revenue declined significantly following the U.S. government export control regulations imposed in October. Although we have not received licenses from the U.S. government to ship restricted products to China, we have started shipping alternatives that don't require a license for the China market. China represented a mid-single digit percentage of our data center revenue in Q4. And we expect it to stay in a similar range in the first-quarter. In regions outside of the U.S. and China, sovereign AI has become an additional demand driver. Countries around the world are investing in AI infrastructure to support the building of large-language models in their own language, on domestic data and in support of their local research and enterprise ecosystems. From a product perspective, the vast majority of revenue was driven by our Hopper architecture along with InfiniBand networking. Together, they have emerged as the de-facto standard for accelerated computing and AI infrastructure. We are on track to ramp H200 with initial shipments in the second quarter. Demand is strong as H200 nearly doubles the inference performance of H100. Networking exceeded a $13 billion annualized revenue run rate. Our end-to-end networking solutions define modern AI data centers. Our Quantum InfiniBand solutions grew more than 5x year on year. NVIDIA Quantum InfiniBand is the standard for the highest performance AI-dedicated infrastructures. We are now entering the ethernet networking space with the launch of our new Spectrum-X end-to-end offering designed for an AI-optimized networking for the data center. Spectrum-X introduces new technologies over ethernet, that are purpose built for AI. Technologies incorporated in our Spectrum switch, BlueField DPU and software stack deliver 1.6x higher networking performance for AI processing compared with traditional ethernet. Leading OEMs, including Dell, HPE, Lenovo and Super Micro, with their global sales channels, are partnering with us to expand our AI solution to enterprises worldwide. We are on track to ship Spectrum-X this quarter. We also made great progress with our software and services offerings, which reached an annualized revenue run rate of $1 billion in Q4. We announced that NVIDIA DGX Cloud will expand its list of partners to include Amazon's AWS, joining Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud and Oracle Cloud. DGX Cloud is used for NVIDIA's own AI R&D and custom model development as well as NVIDIA developers. It brings the CUDA ecosystem to NVIDIA CSP partners. Okay, moving to gaming. Gaming revenue was $2.87 billion, was flat sequentially and up 56% year on year, better than our outlook on solid consumer demand for NVIDIA GeForce RTX GPUs during the holidays. Fiscal year revenue of $10.45 billion was up 15%. At CES, we announced our GeForce RTX 40 Super Series family of GPUs. Starting at $599, they deliver incredible gaming performance and generative AI capabilities. Sales are off to a great start. NVIDIA AI Tensor cores and the GPUs deliver up to 836 AI tops, perfect for powering AI for gaming, creating an everyday productivity. The rich software stack we offer with our RTX GPUs further accelerates AI. With our DLSS technologies, seven out of eight pixels can be AI generated, resulting up to 4x faster ray tracing and better image quality. And with the Tensor RT LLM for Windows, our open-source library that accelerates inference performance for the latest large-language models generative AI can run up to 5X faster on RTX AI PCs. At CES, we also announced a wave of new RTX 40 Series AI laptops from every major OEMs. These bring high-performance gaming and AI capabilities to a wide range of form factors, including 14 inch and thin and light laptops. With up to 686 tops of AI performance, these next-generation AI PCs increase generative AI performance by up to 60x, making them the best-performing AI PC platforms. At CES, we announced NVIDIA Avatar Cloud Engine microservices, which allowed developers to integrate state-of-the-art generative AI models into digital avatars. ACE won several Best of CES 2024 awards. NVIDIA has an end-to-end platform for building and deploying generative AI applications for RTX PCs and workstations. This includes libraries, SDKs, tools and services developers can incorporate into their generative AI workloads. NVIDIA is fueling the next wave of generative AI applications coming to the PC. With over 100 million RTX PCs in the installed-base and over 500 AI-enabled PC applications and games, we are on our way. Moving to Pro Visualization. Revenue of $463 million was up 11% sequentially and up 105% year on year. Fiscal year revenue of $1.55 billion was up 1%. Sequential growth in the quarter was driven by a rich mix of RTX Ada architecture GPUs continuing to ramp. Enterprises are refreshing their workstations to support generative AI-related workloads, such as data preparation, LLM fine-tuning and retrieval augmented generation. These key industrial verticals driving demand include manufacturing, automotive and robotics. The automotive industry has also been an early adopter of NVIDIA Omniverse as it seeks to digitize work flows from design to build, simulate, operate and experience their factories and cars. At CES, we announced that creative partners and developers including Brickland, WPP and ZeroLight are building Omniverse-powered car configurators. Leading automakers like LOTUS are adopting the technology to bring new levels of personalization, realism and interactivity to the car buying experience. Moving to Automotive. Revenue was $281 million, up 8% sequentially and down 4% year on year. Fiscal year revenue of $1.09 billion was up 21%, crossing the $1 billion mark for the first time on continued adoption of the NVIDIA DRIVE platform by automakers. NVIDIA DRIVE Orin is the AI car computer of choice for software-defined AV fleets. Its successor, NVIDIA DRIVE Thor, designed for vision transformers often -- offers more AI performance and integrates a wide range of intelligent capabilities into a single AI compute platform, including autonomous driving and parking, driver and passenger monitoring and AI cockpit functionality and will be available next year. There were several automotive customer announcements this quarter, Li Auto, Great Wall Motor, ZEEKR, the premium EV subsidiary of Geely and Jeremy Xiaomi EV all announced new vehicles built on NVIDIA. Moving to the rest of the P&L. GAAP gross margins expanded sequentially to 76% and non-GAAP gross margins to 76.7% on strong data center growth and mix. Our gross margins in Q4 benefited from favorable component costs. Sequentially, GAAP operating expenses were up 6% and non-GAAP operating expenses were up 9%, primarily reflecting higher compute and infrastructure investments and employee growth. In Q4, we returned $2.8 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and cash dividends. During fiscal year '24, we utilized cash of $9.9 billion towards shareholder returns, including $9.5 billion in share repurchases. Let me turn to the outlook for the first quarter. Total revenue is expected to be $24 billion, plus or minus 2%. We expect sequential growth in data center and proviz, partially offset by seasonal decline in gaming. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 76.3% and 77% respectively, plus or minus 50 basis-points. Similar to Q4, Q1 gross margins are benefiting from favorable component costs. Beyond Q1, for the remainder of the year, we expect gross margins to return to the mid-70s percent range. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $3.5 billion and $2.5 billion respectively. Fiscal year 2025 GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to grow in the mid-30% range as we continue to invest in the large opportunities ahead of us. GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are expected to be an income of approximately $250 million, excluding gains and losses from non-affiliated investments. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 17%, plus or minus 1% excluding any discrete items. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website. In closing, let me highlight some upcoming events for the financial community. We will attend the Morgan Stanley Technology and Media and Telecom Conference in San Francisco on March 4 and the TD Cowen's 44th Annual Healthcare Conference in Boston on March 5. And of course, please join us for our Annual DTC conference starting Monday March 18 in San Jose, California, to be held in-person for the first time in five years. DTC will kick off with Jen-Hsun's keynote and we will host a Q&A session for financial analysts the next day, March 19. At this time, we will now open the call for questions. Operator, would you please poll for questions?"}],"qanda":[{"speaker":"Operator","text":"[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open."},{"speaker":"Toshiya Hari","text":"Hi. Thank you so much for taking the question and congratulations on the really strong results. My question is for Jen-Hsun on the data center business. Clearly, you're doing extremely well in the business. I'm curious how your expectations for calendar '24 and '25 have evolved over the past 90 days. And as you answer the question, I was hoping you can touch on some of the newer buckets within data center, things like software. Sovereign AI, I think you've been pretty vocal about how to think about that medium-to-long term. And recently, there was an article about NVIDIA potentially participating in the ASIC market. Is there any credence to that, and if so, how should we think about you guys playing in that market over the next several years? Thank you."},{"speaker":"Jensen Huang","text":"Thanks, Toshiya. Let's see. There were three questions, one more time. First question was -- can you -- well?"},{"speaker":"Toshiya Hari","text":"I guess your expectations for data center, how they've evolved. Thank you."},{"speaker":"Jensen Huang","text":"Okay. Yeah. Well, we guide one quarter at a time. But fundamentally, the conditions are excellent for continued growth calendar '24, to calendar '25 and beyond. And let me tell you why? We're at the beginning of two industry-wide transitions and both of them are industry wide. The first one is a transition from general to accelerated computing. General-purpose computing, as you know, is starting to run out of steam. And you can tell by the CSPs extending and many data centers, including our own for general-purpose computing, extending the depreciation from four to six years. There's just no reason to update with more CPUs when you can't fundamentally and dramatically enhance its throughput like you used to. And so you have to accelerate everything. This is what NVIDIA has been pioneering for some time. And with accelerated computing, you can dramatically improve your energy efficiency. You can dramatically improve your cost in data processing by 20 to 1. Huge numbers. And of course, the speed. That speed is so incredible that we enabled a second industry-wide transition called generative AI. Generative AI, I'm sure we're going to talk plenty -- plenty about it during the call. But remember, generative AI is a new application. It is enabling a new way of doing software, new types of software are being created. It is a new way of computing. You can't do generative AI on traditional general-purpose computing. You have to accelerate it. And the third is it is enabling a whole new industry, and this is something worthwhile to take a step back and look at and it connects to your last question about sovereign AI. A whole new industry in the sense that for the very first time a data center is not just about computing data and storing data and serving the employees of a company. We now have a new type of data center that is about AI generation, an AI generation factory. And you've heard me describe it as AI factories. But basically, it takes raw material, which is data, it transforms it with these AI supercomputers that NVIDIA builds, and it turns them into incredibly valuable tokens. These tokens are what people experience on the amazing ChatGPT or Midjourney or, search these days are augmented by that. All of your recommender systems are now augmented by that, the hyper-personalization that goes along with it. All of these incredible startups in digital biology, generating proteins and generating chemicals and the list goes on. And so all of these tokens are generated in a very specialized type of data center. And this data center we call AI supercomputers and AI generation factories. But we're seeing diversity -- one of the other reasons -- so at the foundation is that. The way it manifests into new markets is in all of the diversity that you're seeing us in. One, the amount of inference that we do is just off the charts now. Almost every single time you interact with ChatGPT, that we're inferencing. Every time you use Midjourney, we're inferencing. Every time you see amazing -- these Sora videos that are being generated or Runway, the videos that they're editing, Firefly, NVIDIA is doing inferencing. The inference part of our business has grown tremendously. We estimate about 40%. The amount of training is continuing, because these models are getting larger and larger, the amount of inference is increasing. But we're also diversifying into new industries. The large CSPs are still continuing to build out. You can see from their CapEx and their discussions, but there's a whole new category called GPU specialized CSPs. They specialize in NVIDIA AI infrastructure, GPU specialized CSPs. You're seeing enterprise software platforms deploying AI. ServiceNow is just a really, really great example. You see Adobe. There's the others, SAP and others. You see consumer Internet services that are now augmenting all of their services of the past with generative AI. So they can have even more hyper-personalized content to be created. You see us talking about industrial generative AI. Now our industries represent multi-billion dollar businesses, auto, health, financial services. In total, our vertical industries are multi-billion dollar businesses now. And of course sovereign AI. The reason for sovereign AI has to do with the fact that the language, the knowledge, the history, the culture of each region are different and they own their own data. They would like to use their data, train it with to create their own digital intelligence and provision it to harness that raw material themselves. It belongs to them, each one of the regions around the world. The data belongs to them. The data is most useful to their society. And so they want to protect the data. They want to transform it themselves, value-added transformation, into AI and provision those services themselves. So we're seeing sovereign AI infrastructure is being built in Japan, in Canada, in France, so many other regions. And so my expectation is that what is being experienced here in the United States, in the West, will surely be replicated around the world, and these AI generation factories are going to be in every industry, every company, every region. And so I think the last -- this last year, we've seen a generative AI really becoming a whole new application space, a whole new way of doing computing, a whole new industry is being formed and that's driving our growth."},{"speaker":"Operator","text":"Your next question comes from the line of Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open."},{"speaker":"Joe Moore","text":"Great. Thank you. I wanted to follow up on the 40% of revenues coming from inference. That's a bigger number than I expected. Can you give us some sense of where that number was maybe a year before, how much you're seeing growth around LLMs from inference? And how are you measuring that? Is that -- I assume it's in some cases the same GPUs you use for training and inference. How solid is that measurement? Thank you."},{"speaker":"Jensen Huang","text":"I'll go backwards. The estimate is probably understated. And -- but we estimated it. And let me tell you why. Whenever -- a year ago, the recommender systems that people are -- when you run the internet, the news, the videos, the music, the products that are being recommended to you because as you know, the internet has trillions -- I don't know how many trillions, but trillions of things out there and your phone is 3-inches square. And so the ability for them to fit all of that information down to something, such a small real estate, is through a system, an amazing system called recommender systems. These recommender systems used to be all based on CPU approaches. But the recent migration to deep learning and now generative AI has really put these recommender systems now directly into the path of GPU acceleration. It needs GPU acceleration for the embeddings. It needs GPU acceleration for the nearest neighbor search. It needs GPU acceleration for the re-ranking and it needs GPU acceleration to generate the augmented information for you. So GPUs are in every single step of a recommender system now. And as you know, recommender system is the single largest software engine on the planet. Almost every major company in the world has to run these large recommender systems. Whenever you use ChatGPT, it's being inferenced. Whenever you hear about Midjourney and just the number of things that they're generating for consumers, when you when you see Getty, the work that we do with Getty and Firefly from Adobe. These are all generative models. The list goes on. And none of these, as I mentioned, existed a year ago, 100% new."},{"speaker":"Operator","text":"Your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Your line is open."},{"speaker":"Stacy Rasgon","text":"Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted Colette -- I wanted to touch on your comment that you expected the next generation of products -- I assume that meant Blackwell, to be supply constrained. Could you dig into that a little bit, what is the driver of that? Why does that get constrained as Hopper is easing up? And how long do you expect that to be constrained, like do you expect the next generation to be constrained like all the way through calendar '25, like when do those start to ease?"},{"speaker":"Jensen Huang","text":"Yeah. The first thing is overall, our supply is improving, overall. Our supply chain is just doing an incredible job for us, everything from of course the wafers, the packaging, the memories, all of the power regulators, to transceivers and networking and cables and you name it. The list of components that we ship -- as you know, people think that NVIDIA GPUs is like a chip. But the NVIDIA Hopper GPU has 35,000 parts. It weighs 70 pounds. These things are really complicated things we've built. People call it an AI supercomputer for good reason. If you ever look in the back of the data center, the systems, the cabling system is mind boggling. It is the most dense complex cabling system for networking the world's ever seen. Our InfiniBand business grew 5x year over year. The supply chain is really doing fantastic supporting us. And so overall, the supply is improving. We expect the demand will continue to be stronger than our supply provides and -- through the year and we'll do our best. The cycle times are improving and we're going to continue to do our best. However, whenever we have new products, as you know, it ramps from zero to a very large number. And you can't do that overnight. Everything is ramped up. It doesn't step up. And so whenever we have a new generation of products -- and right now, we are ramping H200's. There is no way we can reasonably keep up on demand in the short term as we ramp. We're ramping Spectrum-X. We're doing incredibly well with Spectrum-X. It's our brand-new product into the world of ethernet. InfiniBand is the standard for AI-dedicated systems. Ethernet with Spectrum-X --ethernet is just not a very good scale-out system. But with Spectrum-X, we've augmented, layered on top of ethernet, fundamental new capabilities like adaptive routing, congestion control, noise isolation or traffic isolation, so that we could optimize ethernet for AI. And so InfiniBand will be our AI-dedicated infrastructure. Spectrum-X will be our AI-optimized networking and that is ramping, and so we'll -- with all of the new products, demand is greater than supply. And that's just kind of the nature of new products and so we work as fast as we can to capture the demand. But overall, overall net-net, overall, our supply is increasing very nicely."},{"speaker":"Operator","text":"Your next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay from TD Cowen. Your line is open."},{"speaker":"Matt Ramsay","text":"Good afternoon, Jensen, Colette. Congrats on the results. I wanted to ask I guess a two-part question, and it comes at what Stacy was just getting out on your demand being significantly more than your supply, even though supply is improving. And I guess the two sides of the question are, I guess, first for Colette, like how are you guys thinking about allocation of product in terms of customer readiness to deploy and sort of monitoring if there's any kind of build-up of product that might not yet be turned on? And then I guess Jen-Hsun, for you, I'd be really interested to hear you speak a bit about the thought that you and your company are putting into the allocation of your product across customers, many of which compete with each other, across industries to smaller startup companies, to things in the healthcare arena to government. It's a very, very unique technology that you're enabling and I'd be really interested to hear you speak a bit about how you think about quote/unquote fairly allocating sort of for the good of your company, but also for the good of the industry. Thanks."},{"speaker":"Colette Kress","text":"Let me first start with your question, thanks, about how we are working with our customers as they look into how they are building out their GPU instances and our allocation process. The folks that we work with, our customers that we work with, have been partners with us for many years as we have been assisting them both in what they set up in the cloud, as well as what they are setting up internally. Many of these providers have multiple products going at one time to serve so many different needs across their end customers but also what they need internally. So they are working in advance, of course, thinking about those new clusters that they will need. And our discussions with them continue not only on our Hopper architecture, but helping them understand the next wave and getting their interest and getting their outlook for the demand that they want. So it's always a moving process in terms of what they will purchase, what is still being built and what is in use for our end customers. But the relationships that we've built and their understanding of the sophistication of the build has really helped us with that allocation and both helped us with our communications with them."},{"speaker":"Jensen Huang","text":"First, our CSPs have a very clear view of our product road map and transitions. And that transparency with our CSPs gives them the confidence of which products to place and where and when. And so they know their -- they know the timing to the best of our ability. And they know quantities and of course allocation. We allocate fairly. We allocate fairly. We do the best of our -- do the best we can to allocate fairly and to avoid allocating unnecessarily. As you mentioned earlier, why allocate something when the data center's not ready. Nothing is more difficult then to have anything sit around. And so, allocate fairly, and to avoid allocating unnecessarily. And where we do -- the question that you asked about the end markets, that we have an excellent ecosystem with OEMs, ODMs, CSPs and, very importantly, end markets. What NVIDIA is really unique about is that we bring our customers, we bring our partners, CSPs and OEMs, we bring them customers. The biology companies, the healthcare companies, financial services companies, AI developers, large-language model developers, autonomous vehicle companies, robotics companies. There's just a giant suite of robotics companies that are emerging. There are warehouse robotics to surgical robotics to humanoid robotics, all kinds of really interesting robotics companies, agriculture robotics companies. All of these startups, large companies, healthcare, financial services and auto and such are working on NVIDIA's platform. We support them directly. And oftentimes, we can have a twofer by allocating to a CSP and bringing the customer to the CSP at the same time. And so this ecosystem, you're absolutely right that it's vibrant. But at the core of it, we want to allocate fairly with avoiding waste and looking for opportunities to connect partners and end users. We're looking for those opportunities all the time."},{"speaker":"Operator","text":"Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your line is open."},{"speaker":"Timothy Arcuri","text":"Thanks a lot. I wanted to ask about how you're converting backlog into revenue. Obviously, lead times for your products have come down quite a bit. Colette, you didn't talk about the inventory purchase commitments. But if I sort of add up your inventory plus the purchase commits and your prepaid supply, sort of the aggregate of your supply, it was actually down a touch. How should we read that? Is that just you saying that you don't need to make as much of a financial commitment to your suppliers because the lead times are lower or is that maybe you're reaching some sort of steady state where you're closer to filling your order book and your backlog? Thanks."},{"speaker":"Colette Kress","text":"Yeah. So let me, highlight on those three different areas of how we look at our suppliers. You're correct. Our inventory on hand given our allocation that we're on, we're trying to, as things come into inventory, immediately work to ship them to our customers. I think our customer appreciates our ability to meet the schedules that we've looked for. The second piece of it is our purchase commitments. Our purchase commitments have many different components into it, components that we need for manufacturing. But also, often we are procuring capacity that we may need. The length of that need for capacity or the length for the components are all different. Some of them may be for the next two quarters, but some of them may be for multiple years. I can say the same regarding our prepaids. Our prepaids are pre-designed to make sure that we have the reserve capacity that we need at several of our manufacturing suppliers as we look forward. So wouldn't read into anything regarding approximately about the same numbers as we are increasing our supply. All of them just have different lengths as we have sometimes had to buy things in long-lead times or things that needed capacity to be built for us."},{"speaker":"Operator","text":"Your next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes from Melius Research. Your line is open."},{"speaker":"Ben Reitzes","text":"Yeah. Thanks. Congratulations on the results. Colette, I wanted to talk about your comment regarding gross margins and that they should go back to the mid-70s. If you don't mind unpacking that. And also, is that due to the HBM content in the new products and what do you think are the drivers of that comment? Thanks so much."},{"speaker":"Colette Kress","text":"Yeah. Thanks for the question. We highlighted in our opening remarks really about our Q4 results and our outlook for Q1. Both of those quarters are unique. Those two quarters are unique in their gross margin as they include some benefit from favorable component cost in the supply chain kind of across both our compute and networking and also in several different stages of our manufacturing process. So looking forward, we have visibility into a mid-70s gross margin for the rest of the fiscal year, taking us back to where we were before this Q4 and Q1 peak that we've had here. So we're really looking at just a balance of our mix. Mix is always going to be our largest driver of what we will be shipping for the rest of the year. And those are really just the drivers."},{"speaker":"Operator","text":"Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open."},{"speaker":"C.J. Muse","text":"Yeah. Good afternoon, and thank you for taking the question. Bigger picture question for you, Jen-Hsun. When you think about the million-x improvement in GPU compute over the last decade and expectations for similar improvements in the next, how do your customers think about the long-term usability of their NVIDIA investments that they're making today? Do today's training clusters become tomorrow's inference clusters? How do you see this playing out? Thank you."},{"speaker":"Jensen Huang","text":"Hey, CJ. Thanks for the question. Yeah, that's the really cool part. If you look at the reason why we're able to improve performance so much, it's because we have two characteristics about our platform. One, is that it's accelerated. And two, it's programmable. It's not brittle. NVIDIA is the only architecture that has gone from the very, very beginning, literally the very beginning when CNN's and Alex Krizhevsky and Ilya Sutskever and Geoff Hinton first revealed AlexNet, all the way through to RNNs to LSTMs to every -- RLs to deep learning RLs to transformers to every single version. Every single version and every species that have come along, vision transformers, multi-modality transformers, every single -- and now time sequence stuff, and every single variation, every single species of AI that has come along, we've been able to support it, optimize our stack for it and deploy it into our installed base. This is really the great amazing part. On the one hand, we can invent new architectures and new technologies like our Tensor cores, like our transformer engine for Tensor cores, improved new numerical formats and structures of processing like we've done with the different generations of Tensor cores, meanwhile, supporting the installed base at the same time. And so, as a result, we take all of our new software algorithm invest -- inventions, all of the inventions, new inventions of models of the industry, and it runs on our installed base on the one hand. On the other hand, whenever we see something revolutionary we can -- like transformers, we can create something brand new like the Hopper transformer engine and implement it into future. And so we simultaneously have this ability to bring software to the installed base and keep making it better and better and better, so our customers installed base is enriched over time with our new software. On the other hand, for new technologies, create revolutionary capabilities. Don't be surprised if in our future generation, all of a sudden amazing breakthroughs in large-language models were made possible And those breakthroughs, some of which will be in software because they run CUDA, will be made available to the installed base. And so we carry everybody with us on the one hand. We make giant breakthroughs on the other hand."},{"speaker":"Operator","text":"Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. Your line is open."},{"speaker":"Aaron Rakers","text":"Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about the China business. I know that in your prepared comments you said that you started shipping some alternative solutions into China. You also put it out that you expect that contribution to continue to be about a mid-single digit percent of your total data center business. So I guess the question is what is the extent of products that you're shipping today into the China market and why should we not expect that maybe other alternative solutions come to the market and expand your breadth to participate in that in that opportunity again? Thank you."},{"speaker":"Jensen Huang","text":"Think of, at the core, remember the US government wants to limit the latest capabilities of NVIDIA's accelerated computing and AI to the Chinese market. And the U.S. government would like to see us be as successful in China as possible. Within those two constraints, within those two pillars if you will, are the restrictions, and so we had to pause when the new restrictions came out. We immediately paused. So that we understood what the restrictions are, reconfigured our products in a way that is not software hackable in any way. And that took some time. And so we reset -- we reset our product offering to China and now we're sampling to customers in China. And we're going to do our best to compete in that marketplace and succeed in that marketplace within the -- within the specifications of the restriction. And so that's it. We -- this last quarter, we -- our business significantly declined as we -- as we paused in the marketplace. We stopped shipping in the marketplace. We expect this quarter to be about the same. But after, that hopefully we can go compete for our business and do our best, and we'll see how it turns out."},{"speaker":"Operator","text":"Your next question comes from the line of Harsh Kumar from Piper Sandler. Your line is open."},{"speaker":"Harsh Kumar","text":"Yeah. Hey, Jen-Hsun, Colette and NVIDIA team. First of all, congratulations on a stunning quarter and guide. I wanted to talk about, a little bit about your software business and it's pleasing to hear that it's over a $1 billion but I was hoping Jen-Hsun or Colette if you could just help us understand what the different parts and pieces are for the software business? In other words, just help us unpack it a little bit, so we can get a better understanding of where that growth is coming from."},{"speaker":"Jensen Huang","text":"Let me take a step back and explain the fundamental reason why NVIDIA will be very successful in software. So first, as you know, accelerated computing really grew in the cloud. In the cloud, the cloud service providers have really large engineering teams and we work with them in a way that allows them to operate and manage their own business. And whenever there are any issues, we have large teams assigned to them. And their engineering teams are working directly with our engineering teams and we enhance, we fix, we maintain, we patch the complicated stack of software that's involved in accelerated computing. As you know, accelerated computing is very different than general-purpose computing. You're not starting from a program like C++. You compile it and things run on all your CPUs. The stacks of software necessary for every domain from data processing SQL versus -- SQL structure data versus all the images and text and PDF, which is unstructured, to classical machine-learning to computer vision to speech to large-language models, all --recommender systems. All of these things require different software stacks. That's the reason why NVIDIA has hundreds of libraries. If you don't have software, you can't open new markets. If you don't have software, you can't open and enable new applications. Software is fundamentally necessary for accelerated computing. This is the fundamental difference between accelerated computing and general-purpose computing that most people took a long time to understand. And now, people understand that the software is really key. And the way that we work with CSPs, that's really easy. We have large teams that are working with their large teams. However, now that generative AI is enabling every enterprise and every enterprise software company to embrace accelerated computing -- and when -- it is now essential to embrace accelerated computing because it is no longer possible, no longer likely anyhow to sustain improved throughput through just general-purpose computing. All of these enterprise software companies and enterprise companies don't have large engineering teams to be able to maintain and optimize their software stack to run across all of the world's clouds and private clouds and on-prem. So we are going to do the management, the optimization, the patching, the tuning, the installed-base optimization for all of their software stacks. And we containerize them into our stack. We call it NVIDIA AI Enterprise. And the way we go to market with it is that think of that NVIDIA AI Enterprise now as a run time like an operating system, it's an operating system for artificial intelligence. And we charge $4,500 per GPU per year. And my guess is that every enterprise in the world, every software enterprise company that are deploying software in all the clouds and private clouds and on-prem, will run on NVIDIA AI Enterprise, especially obviously for our GPUs. And so this is going to likely be a very significant business over time. We're off to a great start. And Colette mentioned that it's already at $1 billion run rate and we're really just getting started."},{"speaker":"Operator","text":"Thank you. I will now turn the call back over to Jen-Hsun Huang, CEO, for closing remarks."},{"speaker":"Jensen Huang","text":"The computer industry is making two simultaneous platform shifts at the same time. The trillion-dollar installed base of data centers is transitioning from general purpose to accelerated computing. Every data center will be accelerated so the world can keep up with the computing demand, with increasing throughput, while managing costs and energy. The incredible speed up of NVIDIA enabled -- that NVIDIA enabled, a whole new computing paradigm, generative AI, where software can learn, understand and generate any information from human language to the structure of biology and the 3D world. We are now at the beginning of a new industry where AI-dedicated data centers process massive raw data to refine it into digital intelligence. Like AC power generation plants of the last industrial revolution, NVIDIA AI supercomputers are essentially AI generation factories of this Industrial Revolution. Every company in every industry is fundamentally built on their proprietary business intelligence, and in the future, their proprietary generative AI. Generative AI has kicked off a whole new investment cycle to build the next trillion dollars of infrastructure of AI generation factories. We believe these two trends will drive a doubling of the world's data center infrastructure installed base in the next five years and will represent an annual market opportunity in the hundreds of billions. This new AI infrastructure will open up a whole new world of applications not possible today. We started the AI journey with the hyperscale cloud providers and consumer internet companies. And now, every industry is on board, from automotive to healthcare to financial services, to industrial to telecom, media and entertainment. NVIDIA's full stack computing platform with industry-specific applications frameworks and a huge developer and partner ecosystem, gives us the speed, scale and reach to help every company -- to help companies in every industry become an AI company. We have so much to share with you at next month's GTC in San Jose. So be sure to join us.

Revenue of $18.1 billion was up 34% sequentially and up more than 200% year-on-year and well above our outlook for $16 billion. Starting with Data Center. The continued ramp of the NVIDIA HGX platform based on our Hopper Tensor Core GPU architecture, along with InfiniBand end-to-end networking, drove record revenue of $14.5 billion, up 41% sequentially and up 279% year-on-year. NVIDIA HGX with InfiniBand together are essentially the reference architecture for AI supercomputers and data center infrastructures. Some of the most exciting generative AI applications are built and run on NVIDIA, including Adobe Firefly, ChatGPT, Microsoft 365 Copilot, CoAssist, now assist with ServiceNow and Zoom AI Companion. Our Data Center compute revenue quadrupled from last year and networking revenue nearly tripled. Investments in infrastructure for training and inferencing large language models, deep learning, recommender systems and generative AI applications is fueling strong broad-based demand for NVIDIA accelerated computing. Inferencing is now a major workload for NVIDIA AI computing. Consumer Internet companies and enterprises drove exceptional sequential growth in Q3, comprising approximately half of our Data Center revenue and outpacing total growth. Companies like Meta are in full production with deep learning, recommender systems and also investing in generative AI to help advertisers optimize images and text. Most major consumer Internet companies are racing to ramp up generative AI deployment. The enterprise wave of AI adoption is now beginning. Enterprise software companies such as Adobe, Databricks, Snowflake and ServiceNow are adding AI copilots and the systems to their platforms. And broader enterprises are developing custom AI for vertical industry applications such as Tesla in autonomous driving. Cloud service providers drove roughly the other half of our Data Center revenue in the quarter. Demand was strong from all hyperscale CSPs, as well as from a broadening set of GPU-specialized CSPs globally that are rapidly growing to address the new market opportunities in AI. NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPU instances are now generally available in virtually every cloud with instances in high demand. We have significantly increased supply every quarter this year to meet strong demand and expect to continue to do so next year. We will also have a broader and faster product launch cadence to meet the growing and diverse set of AI opportunities. Towards the end of the quarter, the U.S. government announced a new set of export control regulations for China and other markets, including Vietnam and certain countries in the Middle East. These regulations require licenses for the export of a number of our products, including our Hopper and Ampere 100 and 800 series and several others. Our sales to China and other affected destinations derived from products that are now subject to licensing requirements have consistently contributed approximately 20% to 25% of Data Center revenue over the past few quarters. We expect that our sales to these destinations will decline significantly in the fourth quarter. So we believe will be more than offset by strong growth in other regions. The U.S. government designed the regulation to allow the U.S. industry to provide data center compute products to markets worldwide, including China. Continuing to compete worldwide as the regulations encourage, promotes U.S. technology leadership, spurs economic growth and supports U.S. jobs. For the highest performance levels, the government requires licenses. For lower performance levels, the government requires a streamlined prior notification process. And for products even lower performance levels, the government does not require any notice at all. Following the government's clear guidelines, we are working to expand our Data Center product portfolio to offer compliance solutions for each regulatory category, including products for which the U.S. government does not wish to have advance notice before each shipment. We are working with some customers in China and the Middle East to pursue licenses from the U.S. government. It is too early to know whether these will be granted for any significant amount of revenue. Many countries are awakening to the need to invest in sovereign AI infrastructure to support economic growth and industrial innovation. With investments in domestic compute capacity, nations can use their own data to train LLMs and support their local generative AI ecosystems. For example, we are working with India's government and largest tech companies including Infosys, Reliance and Tata to boost their sovereign AI infrastructure. And French private cloud provider, Scaleway, is building a regional AI cloud based on NVIDIA H100 InfiniBand and NVIDIA's AI Enterprise software to fuel advancement across France and Europe. National investment in compute capacity is a new economic imperative and serving the sovereign AI infrastructure market represents a multi-billion dollar opportunity over the next few years. From a product perspective, the vast majority of revenue in Q3 was driven by the NVIDIA HGX platform based on our Hopper GPU architecture with lower contribution from the prior generation Ampere GPU architecture. The new L40S GPU built for industry standard servers began to ship, supporting training and inference workloads across a variety of consumers. This was also the first revenue quarter of our GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip, which combines our ARM-based Grace CPU with a Hopper GPU. Grace and Grace Hopper are ramping into a new multi-billion dollar product line. Grace Hopper instances are now available at GPU specialized cloud providers, and coming soon to Oracle Cloud. Grace Hopper is also getting significant traction with supercomputing customers. Initial shipments to Los Alamos National Lab and the Swiss National Supercomputing Center took place in the third quarter. The UK government announced it will build one of the world's fastest AI supercomputers called Isambard-AI with almost 5,500 Grace Hopper Superchips. German supercomputing center, Julich, also announced that it will build its next-generation AI supercomputer with close to 24,000 Grace Hopper Superchips and Quantum-2 InfiniBand, making it the world's most powerful AI supercomputer with over 90 exaflops of AI performance. All-in, we estimate that the combined AI compute capacity of all the supercomputers built on Grace Hopper across the U.S., Europe and Japan next year will exceed 200 exaflops with more wins to come. Inference is contributing significantly to our data center demand, as AI is now in full production for deep learning, recommenders, chatbots, copilots and text to image generation and this is just the beginning. NVIDIA AI offers the best inference performance and versatility, and thus the lower power and cost of ownership. We are also driving a fast cost reduction curve. With the release of TensorRT-LLM, we now achieved more than 2x the inference performance for half the cost of inferencing LLMs on NVIDIA GPUs. We also announced the latest member of the Hopper family, the H200, which will be the first GPU to offer HBM3e, faster, larger memory to further accelerate generative AI and LLMs. It moves inference speed up to another 2x compared to H100 GPUs for running LLMs like Norma2 (ph). Combined, TensorRT-LLM and H200, increased performance or reduced cost by 4x in just one year. With our customers changing their stack, this is a benefit of CUDA and our architecture compatibility. Compared to the A100, H200 delivers an 18x performance increase for inferencing models like GPT-3, allowing customers to move to larger models and with no increase in latency. Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure and Oracle Cloud will be among the first CSPs to offer H200-based instances starting next year. At last week's Microsoft Ignite, we deepened and expanded our collaboration with Microsoft across the entire stock. We introduced an AI foundry service for the development and tuning of custom generative AI enterprise applications running on Azure. Customers can bring their domain knowledge and proprietary data and we help them build their AI models using our AI expertise and software stock in our DGX cloud, all with enterprise grade security and support. SAP and Amdocs are the first customers of the NVIDIA AI foundry service on Microsoft Azure. In addition, Microsoft will launch new confidential computing instances based on the H100. The H100 remains the top performing and most versatile platform for AI training and by a wide margin, as shown in the latest MLPerf industry benchmark results. Our training cluster included more than 10,000 H100 GPUs or 3x more than in June, reflecting very efficient scaling. Efficient scaling is a key requirement in generative AI, because LLMs are growing by an order of magnitude every year. Microsoft Azure achieved similar results on a nearly identical cluster, demonstrating the efficiency of NVIDIA AI in public cloud deployments. Networking now exceeds a $10 billion annualized revenue run rate. Strong growth was driven by exceptional demand for InfiniBand, which grew fivefold year-on-year. InfiniBand is critical to gaining the scale and performance needed for training LLMs. Microsoft made this very point last week, highlighting that Azure uses over 29,000 miles of InfiniBand cabling, enough to circle the globe. We are expanding NVIDIA networking into the Ethernet space. Our new Spectrum-X end-to-end Ethernet offering with technologies, purpose built for AI, will be available in Q1 next year. With support from leading OEMs, including Dell, HPE and Lenovo. Spectrum-X can achieve 1.6x higher networking performance for AI communication compared to traditional Ethernet offerings. Let me also provide an update on our software and services offerings, where we are starting to see excellent adoption. We are on track to exit the year at an annualized revenue run rate of $1 billion for our recurring software, support and services offerings. We see two primary opportunities for growth over the intermediate term with our DGX cloud service and with our NVIDIA AI Enterprise software, each reflects the growth of enterprise AI training and enterprise AI inference, respectively. Our latest DGX cloud customer announcement was this morning as part of an AI research collaboration with Gentech, the biotechnology pioneer also plans to use our BioNeMo LLM framework to help accelerate and optimize their AI drug discovery platform. We now have enterprise AI partnership with Adobe, Dropbox, Getty, SAP, ServiceNow, Snowflake and others to come. Okay. Moving to Gaming. Gaming revenue of $2.86 billion was up 15% sequentially and up more than 80% year-on-year with strong demand in the important back-to-school shopping season with NVIDIA RTX ray tracing and AI technology now available at price points as low as $299. We entered the holidays with the best-ever line-up for gamers and creators. Gaming has doubled relative to pre-COVID levels even against the backdrop of lackluster PC market performance. This reflects the significant value we've brought to the gaming ecosystem with innovations like RTX and DLSS. The number of games and applications supporting these technologies has exploded in that period, driving upgrades and attracting new buyers. The RTX ecosystem continues to grow. There are now over 475 RTX-enabled games and applications. Generative AI is quickly emerging as the new pillar app for high performance PCs. NVIDIA RTX GPUs to find the most performance AI PCs and workstations. We just released TensorRT-LLM for Windows, which speeds on-device LLM inference up by 4x. With an installed base of over 100 million, NVIDIA RTX is the natural platform for AI application developers. Finally, our GeForce NOW cloud gaming service continues to build momentum. Its library of PC games surpassed 1,700 titles, including the launches of Alan Wake 2, Baldur's Gate 3, Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty and Starfield. Moving to the Pro Vis. Revenue of $416 million was up 10% sequentially and up 108% year-on year. NVIDIA RTX is the workstation platform of choice for professional design, engineering and simulation use cases and AI is emerging as a powerful demand driver. Early applications include inference for AI imaging in healthcare and edge AI in smart spaces and the public sector. We launched a new line of desktop workstations based on NVIDIA RTX Ada Lovelace generation GPUs and ConnectX, SmartNICs offering up to 2x the AI processing ray tracing and graphics performance of the previous generations. These powerful new workstations are optimized for AI workloads such as fine tune AI models, training smaller models and running inference locally. We continue to make progress on Omniverse, our software platform for designing, building and operating 3D virtual worlds. Mercedes-Benz is using Omniverse powered digital twins to plan, design, build and operate its manufacturing and assembly facilities, helping it increase efficiency and reduce defects. Oxxon (ph) is also incorporating Omniverse into its manufacturing process, including end-to-end simulation for the entire robotics and automation pipeline, saving time and cost. We announced two new Omniverse Cloud services for automotive digitalization available on Microsoft Azure, a virtual factory simulation engine and autonomous vehicle simulation engine. Moving to Automotive. Revenue was $261 million, up 3% sequentially and up 4% year-on year, primarily driven by continued growth in self-driving platforms based on NVIDIA DRIVE Orin SOC and the ramp of AI cockpit solutions with global OEM customers. We extended our automotive partnership of Foxconn to include NVIDIA DRIVE for our next-generation automotive SOC. Foxconn has become the ODM for EVs. Our partnership provides Foxconn with a standard AV sensor and computing platform for their customers to easily build a state-of-an-art safe and secure software defined car. Now we're going to move to the rest of the P&L. GAAP gross margin expanded to 74% and non-GAAP gross margin to 75%, driven by higher Data Center sales and lower net inventory reserve, including a 1 percentage point benefit from the release of previously reserved inventory related to the Ampere GPU architecture products. Sequentially, GAAP operating expenses were up 12% and non-GAAP operating expenses were up 10%, primarily reflecting increased compensation and benefits. Let me turn to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. Total revenue is expected to be $20 billion, plus or minus 2%. We expect strong sequential growth to be driven by Data Center, with continued strong demand for both compute and networking. Gaming will likely decline sequentially as it is now more aligned with notebook seasonality. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 74.5% and 75.5%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $3.17 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively. GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are expected to be an income of approximately $200 million, excluding gains and losses from non-affiliated investments. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 15%, plus or minus 1% excluding any discrete items. Further financial information are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website. In closing, let me highlight some upcoming events for the financial community. We will attend the UBS Global Technology Conference in Scottsdale, Arizona, on November 28; the Wells Fargo TMT Summit in Rancho Palos Verdes, California on November 29; the Arete Virtual Tech Conference on December 7; and the J.P. Morgan Health Care Conference in San Francisco on January 8. Our earnings call to discuss the results of our fourth quarter and fiscal 2024 is scheduled for Wednesday, February 21. We will now open the call for questions. Operator, will you please poll for questions."}],"qanda":[{"speaker":"Operator","text":"[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Vivek Arya of Bank of America. Your line is open."},{"speaker":"Vivek Arya","text":"Thanks for taking my question. Just, Colette, wanted to clarify what China contributions are you expecting in Q4. And then, Jensen, the main question is for you, where do you think we are in the adoption curve in terms of your shipments into the generative AI market? Because when I just look at the trajectory of your data center, is growth -- it will be close to nearly 30% of all the spending in data center next year. So what metrics are you keeping an eye on to inform you that you can continue to grow? Just where are we in the adoption curve of your products into the generative AI market? Thank you."},{"speaker":"Colette Kress","text":"So, first let me start with your question, Vivek, on export controls and the impacts that we are seeing in our Q4 outlook and guidance that we provided. We had seen historically over the last several quarters that China and some of the other impacted destinations to be about 20% to 25% of our Data Center revenue. We are expecting in our guidance for that to decrease substantially as we move into Q4. The export controls will have a negative effect on our China business. And we do not have good visibility into the magnitude of that impact even over the long-term. We are though working to expand our Data Center product portfolio to possibly offer new regulation compliance solutions that do not require a license, these products, they may become available in the next coming months. However, we don't expect their contribution to be material or meaningful as a percentage of the revenue in Q4."},{"speaker":"Jensen Huang","text":"Generative AI is the largest TAM expansion of software and hardware that we've seen in several decades. At the core of it, what's really exciting is that, what was largely a retrieval based computing approach, almost everything that you do is retrieved off of storage somewhere, has been augmented now, added with a generative method. And it's changed almost everything. You could see that text-to-text, text-to-image, text-to-video, text-to-3D, text-to-protein, text-to-chemicals, these were things that were processed and typed in by humans in the past. And these are now generative approaches. The way that we access data is changed. It used to be based on explicit queries. It is now based on natural language queries, intention queries, semantic queries. And so, we're excited about the work that we're doing with SAP and Dropbox and many others that you're going to hear about. And one of the areas that is really impactful is the software industry, which is about $1 trillion or so, has been building tools that are manually used over the last couple of decades. And now there's a whole new segment of software called copilots and assistants. Instead of manually used, these tools will have copilots to help you use it. And so, instead of licensing software, we will continue to do that, of course, but we will also hire copilots and assistants to help us use these -- use the software. We'll connect all of these copilots and assistants into teams of AIs, which is going to be the modern version of software, modern version of enterprise business software. And so the transformation of software and the way that software has done is driving the hardware underneath. And you can see that it's transforming hardware in two ways. One is something that's largely independent of generative AI. There's two trends: one is related to accelerated computing, general purpose computing is too wasteful of energy and cost. And now that we have much, much better approaches, call it, accelerated computing, you could save an order of magnitude of energy, you can save an order of magnitude of time or you can save an order of magnitudes of cost by using acceleration. And so, accelerated computing is transitioning, if you will, general purpose computing into this new approach. And that's been augmented by a new class of data centers. This is the traditional data centers that you were just talking about where we represent about a third of that. But there is a new class of data centers and this new class of data centers, unlike the data centers of the past, where you have a lot of applications running used by a great many people that are different tenants that are using the same infrastructure and that data center stores a lot of files. These new data centers are very few applications, if not one application, used by basically one tenant and it processes data, it trains models and then generates tokens and generates AI. And we call these new data centers AI factories. We're seeing AI factories being built out everywhere, and just by every country. And so if you look at the way where we are in the expansion, the transition into this new computing approach, the first wave you saw with large language model start-ups, generative AI start-ups and consumer Internet companies, and weren't in the process of ramping that. Meanwhile, while that's being ramped, you see that we're starting to partner with enterprise software companies who would like to build chatbots and copilots and assistants to augment the tools that they have on their platforms. You're seeing GPU specialized CSPs cropping up all over the world and they are dedicated to do really one thing, which is processing AI. You're seeing sovereign AI infrastructures, people -- countries that now recognize that they have to utilize their own data, keep their own data, keep their own culture, process that data and develop their own AI. You see that in India. Several -- about a year ago in Sweden, you are seeing in Japan. Last week, a big announcement in France. But the number of sovereign AI clouds that are being built is really quite significant. And my guess is that almost every major region will have and surely every major country will have their own AI clouds. And so I think you're seeing just new developments as the generative AI wave propagates through every industry, every company, every region. And so we're at the beginning of this inflection, this computing transition."},{"speaker":"Operator","text":"Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers of Wells Fargo. Your line is open."},{"speaker":"Aaron Rakers","text":"Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about kind of the networking side of the business. Given the growth rates that you've now cited, I think, it's 155% year-over-year and strong growth sequentially, it looks like that business is like almost approaching $2.5 billion to $3 billion quarterly level. I'm curious of how you see Ethernet involved evolving and maybe how you would characterize your differentiation of Spectrum-X relative to the traditional Ethernet stack as we start to think about that becoming part of the networking narrative above and maybe beyond just InfiniBand as we look into next year? Thank you."},{"speaker":"Jensen Huang","text":"Yeah. Thanks for the question. Our networking business is already on a $10 billion plus run rate and it's going to get much larger. And as you mentioned, we added a new networking platform to our networking business recently. The vast majority of the dedicated large scale AI factories standardize on InfiniBand. And the reason for that is not only because of its data rate and not only just the latency, but the way that it moves traffic around the network is really important. The way that you process AI and a multi-tenant hyperscale Ethernet environment, the traffic pattern is just radically different. And with InfiniBand and with software defined networks, we could do congestion control, adaptive routing, performance isolation and noise isolation, not to mention, of course, the day rate and the low latency that -- and a very low overhead of InfiniBand that's natural part of InfiniBand. And so, InfiniBand is not so much just the network, it's also a computing fabric. We've put a lot of software-defined capabilities into the fabric including computation. We will do 40-point calculations and computation right on the switch, and right in the fabric itself. And so that's the reason why that difference in Ethernet versus InfiniBand or InfiniBand versus Ethernet for AI factories is so dramatic. And the difference is profound. And the reason for that is because you've just invested in a $2 billion infrastructure for AI factories. A 20%, 25%, 30% difference in overall effectiveness, especially as you scale up is measured in hundreds of millions of dollars of value. And if you will, renting that infrastructure over the course of four to five years, it really, really adds up. And so InfiniBand's value proposition is undeniable for AI factories. However, as we move AI into enterprise. This is enterprise computing what we'd like to enable every company to be able to build their own custom AIs. We're building customer AIs in our company based on our proprietary data, our proprietary type of skills. For example, recently we spoke about one of the models that we're creating, it's called ChipNeMo; we're building many others. There'll be tens, hundreds of custom AI models that we create inside our company. And our company is -- for all of our employee use, doesn't have to be as high performance as the AI factories we used to train the models. And so we would like the AI to be able to run in Ethernet environment. And so what we've done is we invented this new platform that extends Ethernet; doesn't replace Ethernet, it's 100% compliant with Ethernet. And it's optimized for East-West traffic, which is where the computing fabric is. It adds to Ethernet with an end-to-end solution with Bluefield, as well as our Spectrum switch that allows us to perform some of the capabilities that we have in InfiniBand, not all but some. And we achieved excellent results. And the way we go to market is we go to market with our large enterprise partners who already offer our computing solution. And so, HP, Dell and Lenovo has the NVIDIA AI stack, the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software stack and now they integrate with Bluefield, as well as bundle -- take a market there, Spectrum switch, and they'll be able to offer enterprise customers all over the world with their vast sales force and vast network of resellers a fully integrated, if you will, fully optimized, at least end-to-end AI solution. And so that's basically it, bringing AI to Ethernet for the world's enterprise."},{"speaker":"Operator","text":"Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Joe Moore of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open."},{"speaker":"Joseph Moore","text":"Great. Thank you. I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit more about Grace Hopper and how you see the ability to leverage kind of the microprocessor, how you see that as a TAM expander. And what applications do you see using Grace Hopper versus more traditional H100 applications?"},{"speaker":"Jensen Huang","text":"Yeah. Thanks for the question. Grace Hopper is in production -- in high volume production now. We're expecting next year just with all of the design wins that we have in high performance computing and AI infrastructures, we are on a very, very fast ramp with our first data center CPU to a multi-billion dollar product line. This is going to be a very large product line for us. The capability of Grace Hopper is really quite spectacular. It has the ability to create computing nodes that simultaneously has very fast memory, as well as very large memory. In the areas of vector databases or semantic surge, what is called RAG, retrieval augmented generation. So that you could have a generative AI model be able to refer to proprietary data or a factual data before it generates a response, that data is quite large. And you can also have applications or generative models where the context length is very high. You basically store it in entire book into end-to-end system memory before you ask your questions. And so the context length can be quite large this way. The generative models has the ability to still be able to naturally interact with you on one hand. On the other hand, be able to refer to factual data, proprietary data or domain-specific data, you data and be contextually relevant and reduce hallucination. And so that particular use case for example is really quite fantastic for Grace Hopper. It also serves the customers that really care to have a different CPU than x86. Maybe it's a European supercomputing centers or European companies who would like to build up their own ARM ecosystem and like to build up a full stack or CSPs that have decided that they would like to pivot to ARM, because their own custom CPUs are based on ARM. There are variety of different reasons that drives the success of Grace Hopper, but we're off to a just an extraordinary start. This is a home run product."},{"speaker":"Operator","text":"Your next question comes from the line of Tim Arcuri of UBS. Your line is open."},{"speaker":"Tim Arcuri","text":"Hi. Thanks. I wanted to ask a little bit about the visibility that you have on revenue. I know there's a few moving parts. I guess, on one hand, the purchase commitments went up a lot again. But on the other hand, China bans would arguably pull in when you can fill the demand beyond China. So I know we're not even into 2024 yet and it doesn't sound like, Jensen, you think that next year would be a peak in your Data Center revenue, but I just wanted to sort of explicitly ask you that. Do you think that Data Center can grow even in 2025? Thanks."},{"speaker":"Jensen Huang","text":"Absolutely believe the Data Center can grow through 2025. And there are, of course, several reasons for that. We are expanding our supply quite significantly. We have already one of the broadest and largest and most capable supply chain in the world. Now, remember, people think that the GPU is a chip. But the HGX H100, the Hopper HGX has 35,000 parts, it weighs 70 pounds. Eight of the chips are Hopper. The other 35,000 are not. It is -- even its passive components are incredible. High voltage parts. High frequency parts. High current parts. It is a supercomputer, and therefore, the only way to test a supercomputer is with another supercomputer. Even the manufacturing of it is complicated, the testing of it is complicated, the shipping of it complicated and installation is complicated. And so, every aspect of our HGX supply chain is complicated. And the remarkable team that we have here has really scaled out the supply chain incredibly. Not to mention, all of our HGXs are connected with NVIDIA networking. And the networking, the transceivers, the mix, the cables, the switches, the amount of complexity there is just incredible. And so, I'm just -- first of all, I'm just super proud of the team for scaling up this incredible supply chain. We are absolutely world class. But meanwhile, we're adding new customers and new products. So we have new supply. We have new customers, as I was mentioning earlier. Different regions are standing up GPU specialist clouds, sovereign AI clouds coming out from all over the world, as people realize that they can't afford to export their country's knowledge, their country's culture for somebody else to then resell AI back to them, they have to -- they should, they have the skills and surely with us in combination, we can help them to do that build up their national AI. And so, the first thing that they have to do is, create their AI cloud, national AI cloud. You're also seeing us now growing into enterprise. The enterprise market has two paths. One path -- or if I could say three paths. The first path, of course, just off-the-shelf AI. And there are of course Chat GPT, a fabulous off-the-shelf AI, there'll be others. There's also a proprietary AI, because software companies like ServiceNow and SAP, there are many, many others that can't afford to have their company's intelligence be outsourced to somebody else. And they are about building tools and on top of their tools they should build custom and proprietary and domain-specific copilots and assistants that they can then rent to their customer base. This is -- they're sitting on a goldmine, almost every major tools company in the world is sitting on a goldmine, and they recognize that they have to go build their own custom AIs. We have a new service called an AI foundry, where we leverage NVS (ph) capabilities to be able to serve them in that. And then the next one is enterprises building their own custom AIs, their own custom chatbots, their own custom RAGs. And this capability is spreading all over the world. And the way that we're going to serve that marketplace is with the entire stacks of systems, which includes our compute, our networking and our switches, running our software stack called NVIDIA AI Enterprise, taking it through our market partners, HP, Dell, Lenovo, so on and so forth. And so we're just -- we're seeing the waves of generative AI starting from the start-ups and CSPs, moving to consumer Internet companies, moving to enterprise software platforms, moving to enterprise companies. And then ultimately, one of the areas that you guys have seen us spend a lot of energy on has to do with industrial generative AI. This is where NVIDIA AI and NVIDIA Omniverse comes together and that is a really, really exciting work. And so I think the -- we're at the beginning of a basically across-the-board industrial transition to generative AI to accelerated computing. This is going to affect every company, every industry, every country."},{"speaker":"Operator","text":"Your next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open."},{"speaker":"Toshiya Hari","text":"Hi. Thank you. I wanted to clarify something with Colette real quick, and then I had a question for Jensen as well. Colette, you mentioned that you'll be introducing regulation-compliant products over the next couple of months. Yet, the contribution to Q4 revenue should be relatively limited. Is that a timing issue and could it be a source of reacceleration in growth for Data Center in April and beyond or are the price points such that the contribution to revenue going forward should be relatively limited? And then the question for Jensen, the AI foundry service announcement from last week. I just wanted to ask about that, and hopefully, have you expand on it. How is the monetization model going to work? Is it primarily services and software revenue? How should we think about the long term opportunity set? And is this going to be exclusive to Microsoft or do you have plans to expand to other partners as well? Thank you."},{"speaker":"Colette Kress","text":"Thanks, Toshiya. On the question regarding potentially new products that we could provide to our China customers. It's a significant process to both design and develop these new products. As we discussed, we're going to make sure that we are in full discussions with the U.S. government of our intent to move products as well. Given our state about where we are in the quarter, we're already several weeks into the quarter. So it's just going to take some time for us to go through and discussing with our customers the needs and desires of these new products that we have. And moving forward, whether that's medium-term or long-term, it's just hard to say both the [Technical Difficulty] of what we can produce with the U.S. government and what the interest of our China customers in this. So we stay still focused on finding that right balance for our China customers, but it's hard to say at this time."},{"speaker":"Jensen Huang","text":"Toshiya, thanks for the question. There is a glaring opportunity in the world for AI foundry, and it makes so much sense. First, every company has its core intelligence. It makes up our company. Our data, our domain expertise, in the case of many companies, we create tools, and most of the software companies in the world are tool platforms, and those tools are used by people today. And in the future, it's going to be used by people augmented with a whole bunch of AIs that we hire. And these platforms just got to go across the world and you'll see and we've only announced a few; SAP, ServiceNow, Dropbox, Getty, many others are coming. And the reason for that is because they have their own proprietary AI. They want their own proprietary AI. They can't afford to outsource their intelligence and handout their data, and handout their flywheel for other companies to build the AI for them. And so, they come to us. We have several things that are really essential in a foundry. Just as TSMC as a foundry, you have to have AI technology. And as you know, we have just an incredible depth of AI capability -- AI technology capability. And then second, you have to have the best practice known practice, the skills of processing data through the invention of AI models to create AIs that are guardrails, fine-tuned, so on and so forth, that are safe, so on and so forth. And the third thing is you need factories. And that's what DGX Cloud is. Our AI models are called AI Foundations. Our process, if you will, our CAD system for creating AIs are called NeMo and they run on NVIDIA's factories we call DGX Cloud. Our monetization model is that with each one of our partners they rent a sandbox on DGX Cloud, where we work together, they bring their data, they bring their domain expertise, we bring our researchers and engineers, we help them build their custom AI. We help them make that custom AI incredible. Then that custom AI becomes theirs. And they deploy it on the runtime that is enterprise grade, enterprise optimized or outperformance optimized, runs across everything NVIDIA. We have a giant installed base in the cloud, on-prem, anywhere. And it's secure, securely patched, constantly patched and optimized and supported. And we call that NVIDIA AI Enterprise. NVIDIA AI Enterprise is $4,500 per GP per year, that's our business model. Our business model is basically a license. Our customers then with that basic license can build their monetization model on top of. In a lot of ways we're wholesale, they become retail. They could have a per -- they could have subscription license base, they could per instance or they could do per usage, there is a lot of different ways that they could take a -- create their own business model, but ours is basically like a software license, like an operating system. And so our business model is help you create your custom models, you run those custom models on NVIDIA AI Enterprise. And it's off to a great start. NVIDIA AI Enterprise is going to be a very large business for us."},{"speaker":"Operator","text":"Your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein Research. Your line is open."},{"speaker":"Stacy Rasgon","text":"Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Colette, I wanted to know if it weren't for the China restrictions would the Q4 guide has been higher or are you supply-constrained in just reshipping stuff that would have gone to China elsewhere? And I guess along those lines you give us a feeling for where your lead times are right now in data center and just the China redirection such as-is, is it lowering those lead times, because you've got parts that are sort of immediately available to ship?"},{"speaker":"Colette Kress","text":"Yeah. Stacy, let me see if I can help you understand. Yes, there are still situations where we are working on both improving our supply each and every quarter. We've done a really solid job of ramping every quarter, which has defined our revenue. But with the absence of China for our outlook for Q4, sure, there could have been some things that we are not supply-constrained that we could have sold, but kind of we would no longer can. So could our guidance had been a little higher in our Q4? Yes. We are still working on improving our supply on plan, on continuing growing all throughout next year as well towards that."},{"speaker":"Operator","text":"Your next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay of TD Cowen. Your line is open."},{"speaker":"Matt Ramsay","text":"Thank you very much. Congrats, everybody, on the results. Jensen, I had a two-part question for you, and it comes off of sort of one premise. And the premise is, I still get a lot of questions from investors thinking about AI training as being NVIDIA's dominant domain and somehow inference, even large model inference takes more and more of the TAM that the market will become more competitive. You'll be less differentiated et cetera., et cetera. So I guess the two parts of the question are: number one, maybe you could spend a little bit of time talking about the evolution of the inference workload as we move to LLMs and how your company is positioned for that rather than smaller model inference. And second, up until a month or two ago, I never really got any questions at all about the data processing piece of the AI workloads. So the pieces of manipulating the data before training, between training and inference, after inference and I think that's a large part of the workload now. Maybe you could talk about how CUDA is enabling acceleration of those pieces of the workload. Thanks."},{"speaker":"Jensen Huang","text":"Sure. Inference is complicated. It's actually incredibly complicated. If you -- we this quarter announced one of the most exciting new engines, optimizing compilers called TensorRT-LLM. The reception has been incredible. You got to GitHub, it's been downloaded a ton, a whole lot of stars, integrated into stacks and frameworks all over the world, almost instantaneously. And there are several reasons for that, obviously. We could create TensorRT-LLM, because CUDA is programmable. If CUDA and our GPUs were not so programmable, it would really be hard for us to improve software stacks at the pace that we do. TensorRT-LLM, on the same GPU, without anybody touching anything, improves the performance by a factor of two. And then on top of that, of course, the pace of our innovation is so high. H200 increases it by another factor of two. And so, our inference performance, another way of saying inference cost, just reduced by a factor of four within about a year's time. And so, that's really, really hard to keep up with. The reason why everybody likes our inference engine is because our installed base. We've been dedicated to our installed base for 20 years, 20-plus years. We have an installed base that is not only largest in every single cloud, it's in every available from every enterprise system maker, it's used by companies of just about every industry. And every -- anytime you see a NVIDIA GPU, it runs our stack. It's architecturally compatible, something we've been dedicated to for a very long time. We're very disciplined about it. We make it our, if you will, architecture compatibility is job one. And that has conveyed to the world, the certainty of our platform stability. NVIDIA's platform stability certainty is the reason why everybody builds on us first and the reason why everybody optimizes on us first. All the engineering and all the work that you do, all the invention of technologies that you build on top of NVIDIA accrues to the -- and benefits everybody that uses our GPUs. And we have such a large installed base, large -- millions and millions of GPUs in cloud, 100 million GPUs from people’s PCs just about every workstation in the world, and they all architecturally compatible. And so, if you are an inference platform and you're deploying an inference application, you are basically an application provider. And as a software application provider, you're looking for large installed base. Data processing, before you could train a model, you have to curate the data, you have to dedupe the data, maybe you have to augment the data with synthetic data. So, process the data, clean the data, align the data, normalize the data, all of that data is measured not in bytes or megabytes, it's measured in terabytes and petabytes. And the amount of data processing that you do before data engineering, before that you do training is quite significant. It could represent 30%, 40%, 50% of the amount of work that you ultimately do. And what you -- and ultimately creating a data driven machine learning service. And so data processing is just a massive part. We accelerate Spark, we accelerate Python. One of the coolest things that we just did is called cuDF Pandas. Without one line of code, Pandas, which is the single most successful data science framework in the world. Pandas now is accelerated by NVIDIA CUDA. And just out-of-the box, without the line of code and so the acceleration is really quite terrific and people are just incredibly excited about it. And Pandas was designed for one purpose and one purpose only, really data processing, it's for data science. And so NVIDIA CUDA gives you all of that."},{"speaker":"Operator","text":"Your final question comes from the line of Harlan Sur of J.P. Morgan. Your line is open."},{"speaker":"Harlan Sur","text":"Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. If you look at the history of the tech industry like those companies that have been successful have always been focused on ecosystem; silicon, hardware, software, strong partnerships and just as importantly, right, an aggressive cadence of new products, more segmentation over time. The team recently announced a more aggressive new product cadence in data center from two years to now every year with higher levels of segmentation, training, optimization in printing CPU, GPU, DPU networking. How do we think about your R&D OpEx growth outlook to support a more aggressive and expanding forward roadmap, but more importantly, what is the team doing to manage and drive execution through all of this complexity?"},{"speaker":"Jensen Huang","text":"Gosh. Boy, that's just really excellent. You just wrote NVIDIA's business plan, and so you described our strategy. First of all, there is a fundamental reason why we accelerate our execution. And the reason for that is because it fundamentally drives down cost. When the combination of TensorRT-LLM and H200 reduce the cost for our customers for large model inference by a factor of four, and so that includes, of course, our speeds and feeds, but mostly it's because of our software, mostly the software benefits because of the architecture. And so we want to accelerate our roadmap for that reason. The second reason is to expand the reach of generative AI, the world's number of data center configurations -- this is kind of the amazing thing. NVIDIA is in every cloud, but not one cloud is the same. NVIDIA is working with every single cloud service provider and not one of the networking control plane, security posture is the same. Everybody's platform is different and yet we're integrated into all of their stacks, all of their data centers and we work incredibly well with all of them. And not to mention, we then take the whole thing and we create AI factories that are standalone. We take our platform, we can put them into supercomputers, we can put them into enterprise. Bringing AI to enterprise is something generative AI Enterprise something nobody's ever done before. And we're right now in the process of going to market with all of that. And so the complexity includes, of course, all the technologies and segments and the pace. It includes the fact that we are architecturally compatible across every single one of those. It includes all of the domain specific libraries that we create. The reason why every computer company, without thinking, can integrate NVIDIA into their roadmap and take it to market. And the reason for that is, because there is market demand for it. There is market demand in healthcare, there is market demand in manufacturing, there is market demand, of course, in AI, including financial services, in supercomputing and quantum computing. The list of markets and segments that we have domain specific libraries is incredibly broaden. And then finally, we have an end-to-end solution for data centers; InfiniBand networking, Ethernet networking, x86, ARM, just about every permutation combination of solutions -- technology solutions and software stacks provided. And that translates to having the largest number of ecosystem software developers; the largest ecosystem of system makers; the largest and broadest distribution partnership network; and ultimately, the greatest reach. And that takes -- surely that takes a lot of energy. But the thing that really holds it together, and this is a great decision that we made decades ago, which is everything is architecturally compatible. When we develop a domain specific language that runs on one GPU, it runs on every GPU. When we optimize TensorRT for the cloud, we optimized it for enterprise. When we do something that brings in a new feature, a new library, a new feature or a new developer, they instantly get the benefit of all of our reach. And so that discipline, that architecture compatible discipline that has lasted more than a couple of decades now, is one of the reasons why NVIDIA is still really, really efficient. I mean, we're 28,000 people large and serving just about every single company, every single industry, every single market around the world."},{"speaker":"Operator","text":"Thank you. I will now turn the call back over to Jensen Huang for closing remarks."},{"speaker":"Jensen Huang","text":"Our strong growth reflects the broad industry platform transition from general purpose to accelerated computing and generative AI. Large language models start-ups consumer Internet companies and global cloud service providers are the first movers. The next waves are starting to build. Nations and regional CSPs are building AI clouds to serve local demand. Enterprise software companies like Adobe and Dropbox, SAP and ServiceNow are adding AI copilots and assistants to their platforms. Enterprises in the world's largest industries are creating custom AIs to automate and boost productivity. The generative AI era is in full steam and has created the need for a new type of data center, an AI factory; optimized for refining data and training, and inference, and generating AI. AI factory workloads are different and incremental to legacy data center workloads supporting IT tasks. AI factories run copilots and AI assistants, which are significant software TAM expansion and are driving significant new investment. Expanding the $1 trillion traditional data center infrastructure installed base, empowering the AI Industrial Revolution. NVIDIA H100 HGX with InfiniBand and the NVIDIA AI software stack define an AI factory today. As we expand our supply chain to meet the world's demand, we are also building new growth drivers for the next wave of AI. We highlighted three elements to our new growth strategy that are hitting their stride: CPU, networking, and software and services. Grace is NVIDIA's first data center CPU. Grace and Grace Hopper are in full production and ramping into a new multi-billion dollar product line next year. Irrespective of the CPU choice, we can help customers build an AI factory. NVIDIA networking now exceeds $10 billion annualized revenue run rate. InfiniBand grew five-fold year-over-year, and is positioned for excellent growth ahead as the networking of AI factories. Enterprises are also racing to adopt AI and Ethernet is the standard networking. This week we announced an Ethernet for AI platform for enterprises. NVIDIA Spectrum-X is an end-to-end solution of Bluefield SuperNIC, Spectrum-4 Ethernet switch and software that boosts Ethernet performance by up to 1.6x for AI workloads. Dell, HPE and Lenovo have joined us to bring a full generative AI solution of NVIDIA AI computing, networking and software to the world's enterprises. NVIDIA software and services is on track to exit the year at an annualized run rate of $1 billion. Enterprise software platforms like ServiceNow and SAP need to build and operate proprietary AI. Enterprises need to build and deploy custom AI copilots. We have the AI technology, expertise and scale to help customers build custom models with their proprietary data on NVIDIA DGX Cloud and deploy the AI applications on enterprise grade NVIDIA AI Enterprise. NVIDIA is essentially an AI foundry. NVIDIA's GPUs, CPUs, networking, AI foundry services and NVIDIA AI Enterprise software are all growth engines in full throttle. Thanks for joining us today.
