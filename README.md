# Earning Call Signal Frontend

## What the app does
This is the frontend application for the Earning Call Signal project. It is a React-based web application designed to display and interact with data related to earning calls, processed and provided by a backend service.

## How to run it locally
To run this application locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system.
2.  **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the project's root directory in your terminal and install the necessary dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Start the Development Server**: Once the dependencies are installed, start the application:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    This will typically open the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Any AI/NLP tools, APIs, or models used
This frontend application primarily focuses on data presentation and user interaction. It is designed to consume data from a backend API, which is likely where any AI/NLP tools, APIs, or models for processing earning call signals are utilized. The frontend itself does not directly implement AI/NLP functionalities.

## Key assumptions or limitations
*   **Backend Dependency**: This frontend application assumes the existence of a compatible backend API that provides the necessary earning call data. Without the backend, the application will not function as intended.
*   **Data Format**: It assumes the data received from the backend adheres to a specific JSON structure for proper rendering.
*   **Scalability**: Current implementation might not be optimized for extremely large datasets without further performance considerations.
*   **Error Handling**: Basic error handling is in place, but comprehensive error management for all possible API responses or network issues might require further development.
*   **User Authentication/Authorization**: No Authentication/Authorization mechanisms are implemented.
